    <h1>Kansas Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to run a similarities between jury instructions. The "base" jury instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive.
    The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. 
    Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. 
    Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared.</p>

The handbook is intended to provide basic   information about the jury trial process in an effort to anticipate and answer   many of the questions that prospective jurors often have. It can be mailed to   prospective jurors with their summons, handed to them as they arrive at the   courthouse, or the judge may choose to read all or parts of it to prospective   jurors before or during jury selection. However judges choose to approach   jury orientation and jury selection, the Committee simply recommends that   the handbook be utilized in some fashion.      When orienting or selecting a jury, the trial judge must take care to   be accurate when describing the law or trial procedure and to avoid any   comment(s) that might be perceived as indicating bias or a suggestion as to   how the judge would resolve any of the factual issues in the case.      Comment      A number of cases through the years have involved a claim of error predicated upon comments made   by the trial judge during jury orientation or selection. See State v. Reuter, 126 Kan. 565, 268 Pac. 845   (1928); State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.3d 139 (2001); State v. Plunkett, 257 Kan. 135, 891 P.2d 370   (1995).     The trial court’s jury orientation comments will be reviewed on appeal under the judicial misconduct   standard of review. It must affirmatively appear that the conduct was of such a nature as to prejudice   the substantial rights of the complaining party. State v. Nguyen, 251 Kan. 69, 833 P.2d 937, Syl.

The Importance of Jury Service      Jury service is a serious obligation of all qualified citizens, and is a vital   part of our American system of justice. By carrying out their task well and   faithfully, jurors help resolve controversies, enforce our laws, and preserve   the legal rights of our citizens.      II. Excuses From Jury Duty      Excuses from jury duty should be sought only for reasons of compelling   personal hardship or because requiring jury service would be contrary to the   public health, safety or welfare. Although jury service can be inconvenient or   financially burdensome, experience has shown that most jurors feel that any   such inconvenience or personal expense is far outweighed by the value and   importance of jury service to the community at large. If you believe that you   cannot or should not be required to serve as a juror in this case, you will have   the opportunity to state your reasons to the judge.      III. Composition of Jury Panel      Parties have the right to juries selected from a fair cross section of the   county in which the court convenes. As such, prospective jurors are selected   at random from county voter registration records or lists of licensed drivers   or persons holding state-issued identification cards who reside in the county,   and/or census records.      IV. Civil and Criminal Cases      In civil cases, parties generally claim that their person or property has   been injured or damaged by the wrongful act of another. Money is normally   sought as compensation for the claimed injury. Parties in civil cases may also   seek a court order establishing or enforcing contractual or other legal rights   or obligations. Examples of civil cases would be motor vehicle accident cases   or real estate contract disputes. The person bringing the suit is the plaintiff,   and the party being sued is the defendant.      Criminal cases are those in which the plaintiff is generally the State of   Kansas and is represented by the prosecuting attorney who starts the case   by filing a complaint alleging that the defendant has violated the law in      2016                 "      some respect. The defendant is presumed to be innocent of all charges. The   prosecutor must establish the defendant’s guilt by proof beyond a reasonable   doubt. The defendant is not required to present evidence.      V. Role of the Attorneys, Judge, and Jury      Attorneys have the obligation to represent their clients in a competent   and professional manner. They present evidence to support the claims of   their clients. They may challenge or question the evidence presented by other   parties to the lawsuit. At times they will object to certain evidence offered by   the other parties if they believe that such evidence should not be admitted.      The judge has the duty to decide what evidence may be received and   considered by the jury; to control the progress of the trial; to rule on all   questions of law; and to instruct the jury on the law that applies to a given   case.      The jury has the duty to listen closely to all of the evidence presented by   any party; to determine from that evidence what the facts of the case are; to   apply those facts to the law as instructed by the judge; and thus to arrive at a   verdict in the case.      At times during the trial the judge and attorneys may discuss matters   at the bench or otherwise outside your view or hearing. These conferences   are necessary for various reasons, such as to resolve issues concerning the   admissibility of certain evidence. Judges try to keep these conferences as few   and brief as possible.      VI. Jury Selection Process      On the first day of trial, prospective jurors are given an oath to honestly   answer questions concerning their qualifications to sit as jurors in the case.   This questioning process is called voir dire, a French term meaning “to speak   the truth.” The questioning is done by the judge or by the attorneys, and   sometimes both, and is intended to determine if prospective jurors have any   personal interest in or knowledge of the case; whether they are related to or   personally acquainted with the parties or their attorneys; or whether they, for   whatever reason, have a personal feeling or bias that would make it difficult   for them to be fair and impartial to both sides of the case.      During the questioning of prospective jurors, a person may be challenged   for cause if it is shown that he or she would not be an appropriate juror for   the particular case. The judge will excuse the person from the panel if the   cause given is deemed sufficient. Once the questioning of prospective jurors   is complete, the parties will then exercise a certain number of challenges for   which no cause is necessary. These are known as peremptory challenges. The      2010      "      2010      peremptory challenge is a legal right long recognized as a means of giving both   sides some choice in the make-up of the jury. Jurors should understand that   being removed from the jury panel for cause or by a peremptory challenge is   no reflection upon their ability or integrity.      The judge may also decide to select one or more alternate jurors to serve   in the place of regular jurors who become unable to fulfill their duties at some   point during the trial. Alternate jurors may be selected at the same time the   regular jurors are selected, or after the regular jury has been selected. Alternate   jurors are selected in the same manner, and have the same qualifications and   duties as regular jurors.      VIL. Stages of the Trial      A. Opening Statement. Once the jury has been selected, the attorneys are   entitled to make opening statements outlining what they believe the   evidence in the case will be. These statements are intended to help the   jury in following and understanding the evidence as it is presented.      B. Presentation of Evidence. Following opening statements, the parties   then present the testimony of witnesses and other forms of evidence   in an effort to prove their claims in the lawsuit, or in an effort to   disprove the claims of the other party. Defendants are not required to   present evidence.      C. Instructions By the Judge. Once the parties have presented all of   their evidence, the judge will then prepare and read to the jury a set of   instructions outlining the law that applies to the particular case. The   jurors will take these instructions with them to the jury room to serve   as their guide in the deliberation process.      D. Final Arguments. Following the reading of the jury instructions by   the judge, the attorneys are then entitled to make final arguments in   which they state what they believe the evidence has been and how   the evidence should be viewed and applied in light of the judge’s   instructions.      E. Deliberation and Verdict. The jury will first select one of its members   as presiding juror to sign the verdict form and to speak for the jury   in open court. In a criminal case, the jury’s verdict as to any crime   charged must be unanimous, that is, all jurors must agree upon   the verdict. In a civil case, the agreement of 10 out of 12 jurors is   sufficient.                            VIII. Courtroom Etiquette      The courtroom is a place where all persons should conduct themselves   with dignity, courtesy and proper respect for the court and everyone present.   Noisy or disruptive conduct is not allowed. The clothing worn by jurors may   be casual but should be appropriate for the serious business of the court.   Hats and caps should be removed upon entering the courtroom. If cellular   phones are allowed in the courthouse, they must be turned off at all times   in the courtroom. Newspapers, magazines, books, etc. should be put away.   Quiet and close attention to the proceedings at hand is the order of the day.      IX. Conduct of the Jury During Trial      Each juror must pay close attention to the testimony and keep an open   mind throughout the trial. Jurors can and should use the knowledge they   possess in common with persons in general. Jurors are encouraged to use   their common sense.      Until all of the evidence has been presented and the final instructions   given by the judge, jurors must not discuss the case among themselves or with   anyone else, including anyone outside the courthouse. If anyone attempts to   talk with a juror about the case, the juror should tell this person that such   conversation is not proper and should cease. The juror should also report the   matter to the bailiff at the earliest opportunity.      Jurors must receive all of their information about the case from the trial   itself, and must not rely on any other source of information. Jurors must not   search for, read or listen to any information from the internet relating in any   way to the case. Jurors must avoid listening to, reading or viewing any media   coverage of the case. If during the trial a juror learns some information about   the case outside the trial, the juror should inform the judge. He or she must   not mention any such information to other jurors. Jurors must never inspect   the scene where the events occurred. If such an inspection is necessary, the   judge will have the jurors go as a group to the scene.      Once the case has been submitted to the jury for deliberation of a verdict,   jurors should freely exchange their views and should give proper consideration   to the views of other jurors. No juror is required to abandon any opinion   which the juror believes is correct, but jurors should be willing to change   their opinion if they become convinced by other jurors that such opinion is   not correct.      "      2010      "      2010      X. Accommodating the Needs and Concerns of Jurors      Understanding that jury service can at times be a burden, the judge and   staff will make every effort to minimize any inconveniences. Depending on   the particular county in which the case is handled, information regarding   parking, dining establishments, cellular phone use, disability accommodations,   etc. may be separately provided. Although some cases are shorter in duration   and some can be much longer, the average jury trial takes 2-3 days. Except in   very rare instances, you will be allowed to return home each evening.      During the trial, if you cannot hear the proceeding, or need to take a   restroom break, just raise your hand and let the judge know. If you have   other concerns regarding your comfort or convenience or that of other jurors,   do not hesitate to express that concern to the bailiff during a break in the   proceedings.

Whether you do so is entirely up to you. However, do not allow the taking of   notes to distract you from listening attentively to the testimony of a witness.      You may use your notes to refresh your memory as you deliberate.   However, your deliberations must be based upon the collective memory and   recollection of the entire jury as to the evidence admitted. Notes should be   used only as an aid to this function and not as a substitute.      You must not remove any of your notes from the courthouse. At the   beginning of a recess give your packet of notes to the bailiff. Your notes will   be returned to you when court reconvenes.      At the conclusion of the trial, all notes must be given to the bailiff for   immediate destruction.      Comment      The court may wish to consider the anticipated length of the trial, the technical nature of the subjects   about which the witnesses will testify, and the amount of detail that must be sifted through by the jurors in   order to be competent fact finders.     Note taking by jurors is a matter of “sound judicial discretion.” State v. Jackson, 201 Kan. 795, 799,   443 P.2d 279 (1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 908, 89 S. Ct. 1019, 22 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1969) overruled on other   grounds in State v. Mims, 220 Kan. 726, 556 P.2d 387 (1976). A more comprehensive review of the subject   is contained in 14 A.L.R. 3d 831.     Permitting note taking without having first given the note taking instruction will be judged according   to the “clearly erroneous” standard of review. State v.

At the end of the case, I   will instruct you on the law that you must apply to the evidence in order to   reach a verdict. For your verdict to be fair, you must not be exposed to any   information about the case, the law, or any of the issues involved in this trial   beyond that which is admitted during the trial.      Do not seek information about the case beyond what you see and   hear in this courtroom. Do not use any printed or electronic sources to get   information about this case or any of the issues involved. These sources   include the internet, reference books, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines,   television, radio, computers, smartphones, or any other electronic device. You   must not do any personal investigation about the issues, including visiting any   of the places involved in this case, or use Internet maps or Google Earth to   examine the scene. You cannot talk to any possible witnesses, or create your   own demonstrations or re-enactments of the events which are the subject of   this case.      Do not communicate with anyone about this case or your jury service,   and do not allow anyone to communicate with you. In particular, you may not   talk about the case by using cell phones, emails, text messages, tweets, blogs,   chat rooms, comments or other postings on Facebook or any other website.   You may notify your family and your employer that you have been seated as a   juror in the case. But, if you are asked or approached by anyone, in any way,   about your jury service or anything about this case, you must respond that   you have been ordered not to discuss the matter. You should then report the   contact to the bailiff of the court as soon as possible.      The court recognizes that these rules and restrictions may affect activities   that you would consider to be normal and harmless. However, the law requires   these restrictions to ensure the parties have a fair trial based on the evidence   that each party has had an opportunity to produce and discuss.      Any juror who violates these rules and restrictions jeopardizes the   fairness of these proceedings. Violations may be punished as contempt of   court. In addition, a mistrial could result, causing the entire trial process to   start over. If you become aware that a juror has done something that violates   these instructions, you must report that to the court.      These rules and restrictions remain in effect until you have been   discharged from your jury service.                  "      Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction be read to the jury at the start of every trial. The   proliferation of electronic devices giving unlimited access to outside-the-courtroom sources of information,   human and digital, creates a very real possibility of juror misconduct and resulting mistrials.       2016      "      2012      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 23.701'>  23.701</a>  Modification or Initial Determination of Child Support—Parties Never      Married; Preliminary Inst...</p><p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 00.100'>  00.100</a>  Concluding Remarks   I instruct you, ladies and gentlemen, that you must decide this case for yours...</p><p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 22.001'>  22.001</a>  Divorce (Child Support); Preliminary Instructions   (Read before commencement of trial.)

II. PURPOSE OF VOIR DIRE      As prospective jurors you will be called and questioned so that the Court   may determine your qualifications to serve in this case. The Court and the   attorneys conduct this examination to obtain a fair and impartial jury and   not to pry into your personal affairs. Because this is an important part of the   trial, the law requires that prospective jurors be sworn before questions are   asked. The Clerk will administer the oath.      HI. OATH FOR VOIR DIRE      You, and each of you, do solemnly swear that you will true answers make   to all questions propounded to you by court or counsel, touching upon your   qualifications to serve as jurors in this case, so help you God?      Comment     Kansas Statutes recognizes the right of participation in this examination by the Court and by counsel.   The Committee believes the following are not proper areas for examination:     1. Questions previously asked by Court or counsel, and answered.     2. Questions touching upon anticipated instructions.                  "      3. Questions touching upon the verdict to be returned when those questions are based upon     hypothetical facts and situations.     4. Questions that are in substance arguments of the case.     Additionally, the Committee believes that voir dire is best conducted when questions are not asked   relative to data available from jury information sheets obtainable from the clerk and when collective   questions are used as fully as practicable. Such restrictions as those found above may be made known to   counsel by rule or informal statement.       2012      "      2016      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 22.001'>  22.001</a>  Divorce (Child Support); Preliminary Instructions   (Read before commencement of trial.)

Notes on Use      When giving this instruction for the first time or at the end of each day, the judge may want to include   all or portions of PIK 4" , Base Your Decision As A Juror On What Is Presented In Court, to augment   the recess admonition.      Comment      The trial judge should admonish the jury pursuant to K.S.A. 60-248(d) whenever the jury is permitted   to separate during the trial. But prejudicial error will not be presumed from such failure in the absence of a   showing of substantial prejudicial misconduct on the part of the jurors resulting from a failure to give the   statutory admonishment.

PREFACE TO PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS      Members of the Jury, I will now give you some preliminary instructions   on the law that I believe will be helpful to you in listening to the evidence in   the case and understanding what issues you will be asked to decide at the end   of the case. The instructions that I will give you now are not the complete   instructions, and if the final instructions are different from these preliminary   instructions, it is the final instructions that you must follow in reaching your   verdict.      It sometimes happens that the attorneys and I believe at the beginning of   the case that certain matters will be submitted to you for decision at the end   of the case but the evidence is different from what the parties expected, or a   party decides to abandon a claim or defense. That is why the final instructions   are sometimes different from the preliminary instructions. Therefore, it is   important that you understand that these instructions are only preliminary,   and are meant to help you in listening to the evidence in the case.      B. IF JURY WAS GIVEN PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS      As you remember, I gave you some general instructions before the   attorneys presented any evidence. These preliminary instructions were meant   to help you in listening to the evidence in the case and understanding what   issues you would have to decide to reach your verdict.      The instructions that I am giving you now are the complete and final   instructions. It is these instructions on the law that you must use during   your deliberations. If the final instructions are different from the preliminary   instructions, you should disregard the preliminary instructions and follow   these instructions.      The instructions are in writing and you will have them in the jury room   for your use during deliberations.      Notes on Use   K.S.A. 60-251 provides that the court must instruct the jury at the close of the evidence before   argument. It also gives the trial court the discretion to give the jury instructions at any other time.      This provision creates a great opportunity for the trial judge to assist jurors in understanding their   duty as well as some of the general rules they will use in deciding the case. The Committee recommends      2020      "      2010      that the trial court consider giving some of the basic instructions for considering evidence, the issues and   burden of proof instruction, and any of the instructions on the substantive law regarding duties that are   applicable to the case. In a comparative fault case, the instruction on comparative fault and the jury’s duty   to apportion fault should always be given as a preliminary instruction.     If the judge decides to give preliminary instructions, Part A of this instruction should be given as a   preface to the preliminary instructions, then Part B should be included as part of the final instructions.     Although the Kansas Code of Civil Procedure does not require that the jury be given written   instructions, the Committee believes that the jury should always be given written copies of the final   instructions for use during deliberations. Giving the jury written copies of the final instructions does not   substitute for the court’s duty to give oral instructions—the court should always give the final instructions   orally before final arguments.

A party that has the burden   to prove a claim must persuade you that the claim is more probably true than   not true. In deciding whether this burden has been met, you must consider   all admitted evidence, whether presented by plaintiff or defendant.      Notes on Use      A court should not give this instruction in a land condemnation case. City of Wichita v. Jennings, 199   Kan. 621, 433 P.2d 351 (1967). For a discussion as to the issues in a condemnation suit requiring a burden   of proof instruction, see Comment to PIK 4" , Burden of Proof.      Comment      For a case in which the trial court was held to have properly determined that the burden of proof as to   one of the issues involved had been sustained as a matter of law and consequently was not to be submitted   to the jury, see Thompson v. Norman, 198 Kan. 436, 445, 424 P.2d 593 (1967). The court discussed an   objection that the trial court refused to instruct that the plaintiff could not recover if the evidence was evenly   balanced. Apparently, the defendant had argued that refusal to give this instruction resulted in placing the   burden of proof on him. The objection was held to be unfounded on the basis that the instructions, taken as   a whole, adequately covered the burden of proof as to all issues.

In determining   whether _ insert name of party _ has met this burden you must consider all   admitted evidence, whether presented by plaintiff or defendant.      Evidence is clear and convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact   asserted is highly probable.      Notes on Use      This instruction is to be used when a party has the obligation to prove a fact by clear and convincing   evidence. When the burden of proof of other facts in the case is by a preponderance of the evidence, this   instruction should be given along with PIK 4" , Meaning of Burden of Proof. It should be modified   to make clear the issues of fact to which each burden of proof applies.      Comment      See K.S.A. 60-401(d). A higher and more satisfactory character of proof is required to establish that   an instrument or conveyance is not what it purports to be than is necessary in ordinary civil cases. See   Winston v. Burnell, 44 Kan. 367, 24 P. 477 (1890).     The definition of clear and convincing evidence is based on the holding in Jn re B.D.-Y., 286 Kan.   686, 187 P.3d 594 (2008), which disapproved all contrary definitions in prior opinions and in former PIK   4" .     For standard of proof required in action to cancel oil and gas lease, see Jackman v. Lawrence Drilling   & Development Co., 106 Kan. 59, 187 P. 258 (1920).      For the standard of proof required of one who asserts fraud, see Hoch v. Hoch, 187 Kan. 730, 359   P.2d 839 (1961). See PIK 4" , Fraud—Elements.     Clear and convincing evidence is necessary for third party beneficiaries to prove that testators had   an oral contract between themselves to leave their property to the beneficiaries upon the death of the last   testator. See In re Estate of Stratmann, 248 Kan. 197, 202, 806 P.2d 459 (1991).      Claimants are required to prove a claim for retaliatory discharge by clear and convincing evidence.   Ortega v.

See PIK—Criminal 4" 51.220, in which the Committee recommends that no separate instruction   regarding impeachment be given in criminal cases because the instruction on Credibility of Witnesses   provides the jury adequate guidance. Moreover, in instances where evidence is admissible for one purpose,   e.g. impeachment, but is inadmissible for some other purpose, the appropriate time to give an instruction   limiting the jury’s use of the evidence is when the evidence is received. See K.S.A. 60-404, which codifies   the contemporaneous objection rule, and K.S.A. 60-406, which requires the judge “upon request” to   “restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.”     The final paragraph of the instruction should not be given regarding evidence that is admissible both   for impeachment and for other purposes. For example, prior inconsistent statements of testifying witnesses   ordinarily may also be used under the hearsay exception in K.S.A. 60-460(a) to prove the truth of the   facts asserted in the statement. Prior inconsistent statements of parties, including those in depositions or   answers to interrogatories, may also be used as substantive evidence under the party admissions exception   in K.S.A. 60-460(g). Likewise, there may be instances in which prior convictions involving dishonesty or   false statement may be used not only for impeachment but also for a substantive purpose under K.S.A. 60-   455.      2016      "      2010      Comment      As to evidence generally affecting credibility, see K.S.A. 60-420 and 60-422(c), (d); inconsistent   statements, see K.S.A. 60-422(b); depositions, see K.S.A. 60-232; interrogatories, see K.S.A. 60-233; and   crimes, see K.S.A. 60-421.     For rules as to scope of cross-examination affecting credibility, see Sanders v. Sitton, 179 Kan. 118,   292 P.2d 1099 (1956); State, ex rel. Emery v. Christensen, 132 Kan. 192, 294 P. 892 (1931).     The admissibility of evidence of a conviction is determined by whether the crime involves dishonesty   or false statement and not upon the penalty imposed or whether the crime is a felony or a misdemeanor. In   Tucker v.

Experts   are persons who, from experience, education or training have specialized   knowledge on matters not common to people in general. The law permits   experts to give their opinions about such matters. The testimony of experts   is to be considered like any other testimony and is to be evaluated by the   same tests. You should consider it in connection with all the other facts and   circumstances. You should give it the weight and credit you determine are   appropriate.      Notes on Use      If this instruction is given, it should follow PIK 4" , Credibility of Witnesses.      Comment      See K.S.A. 60-456.

Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction should seldom be given because these matters   would be addressed in closing argument.      Comment      The cases addressing this presumption involve knowledge or information that the party himself had   but did not disclose. In Evenson Trucking Co. v. Aranda, 280 Kan. 821, 127 P.3d 292 (2006), Aranda’s   failure to present a receipt he claimed existed “could create a presumption that no such evidence existed, or   was adverse to him.” In Blackburn v. Colvin, 191 Kan. 239, 380 P.2d 432 (1963), there was evidence that   Colvin had created a dangerous condition on his property but Colvin didn’t take the stand and deny it. The   court concluded that the failure of a party to throw light upon an issue particularly within his knowledge   raises a presumption that the concealed information is unfavorable to him. In Jn re Estate of Grisell, 176   Kan. 209, 270 P.2d 285 (1954), one of the opponents of a will testified and did not deny key evidence, the   truth of which he would certainly know. The court found the failure to deny raised the presumption that his   evidence on the subject would be unfavorable to his position. In Henks v. Panning, 175 Kan. 424, 264 P.2d   483 (1953), the defendants did not testify and, because they had within their own knowledge certain facts   that went unexplained, the presumption that their testimony would not have been favorable to their position   was invoked. In Donley v. Amerada Petroleum Corp., 152 Kan. 518, 106 P.2d 652 (1940), a corporation   failed to put on evidence of how long it had been emptying salt water into a creek, a subject that the court   found to be peculiarly within the corporation’s knowledge, and the presumption was therefore raised that   the information was unfavorable to the corporation.     Although the preceding cases address the issue of the presumption, in none of these cases does it   appear that any instruction regarding the presumption was given to the jury.

It is the failure of a person to   do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      Notes on Use      “Guilt” or “guilty of negligence” should not be used in a civil case.   This definition of negligence is applicable when the standard of care or duty is ordinary or reasonable   care. For other standards of care, the breach of which constitutes negligence, see:   PIK 4" -, , , Professional Negligence   PIK 4" -, Products Liability   PIK 4" -, FELA   PIK 4" -, Miscellaneous—Common Carriers   If negligence of a child is an issue, see PIK 4" , Negligence of Children, and PIK 4" ,   Comparative Fault Theory and Effect—Children.   In a comparative fault case, see PIK 4" , Comparative Fault Theory and Effect.      Comment      The general definition of negligence “is not designed as a specific rule where other standards of care,   i.e., products liability, malpractice, etc., apply.” Akins v. Hamblin, 237 Kan. 742, 747, 703 P.2d 771 (1985).   As a general rule, the presence or absence of negligence in any degree is not subject to determination by the   court on summary judgment. Such a determination should be left to the trier of fact. Only when reasonable   minds could not reach differing conclusions from the same evidence may the issue be decided as a question   of law. Gruhin v. City of Overland Park, 17 Kan. App. 2d 388, 836 P.2d 1222 (1992).      In unique cases where the activities in question are addressed by published industry standards that   are recognized as authoritative, the trial court may need to allow evidence of and instruct the jury as to   the relevant industry standards so as to enable the jury to evaluate the degree of care owed by sponsors or   participants in such activities. See e.g., Pullen v. West, 278 Kan. 183, 6, 92 P.3d 584 (2004), a case   involving the discharge of commercial fireworks at a private Fourth of July party. In addition, the trial court   may also need to allow appropriate expert testimony as to which of such standards apply to the unique facts   of the case. /d. at 210.      2010      "      2010      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.760'>  66.760</a>  Reprehensibility; Amplified   (Note: Because State Farm suggests that reprehensibility is the most ...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.750'>  66.750</a>  Punitive Damages; Amount; Guidelines   (Note: Georgia statutory law does not recognize guidelines f...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 62.300'>  62.300</a>  Physician, Skill Required of   A person professing to practice surgery or the administering of medi...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 62.400'>  62.400</a>  Attorney, Skill Required of   The initial requirement for establishing liability in a case of this ...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 26.030'>  26.030</a>  Fraud and Deceit; Diligence Required of Plaintiff     Before a person is entitled to relief on the ...</p></p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name='103.02' href='#103.02'></a>103.02</h4><p>NEGLIGENCE OF CHILDREN      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to   do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      When you decide whether a child is negligent, you must consider the   child’s age, intelligence, abilities and experiences.      Notes on Use      In a comparative fault case, use the bracketed language in PIK 4" , Comparative Fault Theory   and Effect, rather than this pattern instruction.      Comment      The common-law rule imposing arbitrary age classifications has been abrogated in Kansas. Ordinarily,   the negligence of a child should be determined by the factfinder. Honeycutt v. City of Wichita, 247 Kan.   250, 796 P.2d 549 (1990), appeal after remand 251 Kan. 451, 836 P.2d 1128. But see Williams v. Esaw, 214   Kan. 658, 522 P.2d 950 (1974) (superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Eli v. Board of Sedgwick   County Comm'rs, 235 Kan. 684, 681 P.2d 673 (1984)), which holds that a minor driving an automobile is   held to the same standard as an adult. Under such circumstances, neither this instruction nor PIK 4" ,   Comparative Fault Theory and Effect—Children, should be given.     As to the standard of conduct required of a child driving an automobile, authority is divided, but   one modern view is that where a child engages in an activity which is normally undertaken by adults, and   for which adult qualifications are required, the child is required to exercise that degree of care ordinarily   expected of an adult. See Age of minor operator of automobile or other motor-powered vehicle or craft as   affecting primary or contributory negligence, 97 A.L.R. 2d 872. Kansas appears to have held to the contrary   in Harvey v. Cole, 159 Kan. 239, 153 P.2d 916 (1944) (disapproved in Williams v. Esaw, 214 Kan. 658,   522 P.2d 950 (1974)). In Allen v. Ellis, 191 Kan. 311, 317, 380 P.2d 408 (1963), however, the Kansas court   decided that “There is nothing in the Uniform Operators’ and Chauffeurs’ License Act.... that makes any   exception to the standard of care and caution required as between minors and adults.”                            "      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 60.510'>  60.510</a>  Animals; Knowledge of Viciousness     If such injury is a result of the vicious or dangerous charac...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 16.400'>  16.400</a>  Contracts; Diligence; Negligence   Upon reasonable application and under proper circumstances, a pa...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 60.150'>  60.150</a>  Torts; Emergency     One who is confronted with a sudden emergency that was not created by one’s ow...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 62.311'>  62.311</a>  Physician, Skill Required; After-Acquired Information; Hindsight   (Consider whether this point is ...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.400'>  66.400</a>  Tort Damages; Consortium     A married person has a right to recover for the loss of consortium, so...</p></p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name='103.03' href='#103.03'></a>103.03</h4><p>WANTON CONDUCT DEFINED      Wanton conduct is doing something knowing that it is dangerous, and   either being completely indifferent to the danger or recklessly disregarding   the danger.

In Southgate Bank v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland, 14 Kan. App. 2d 454, 794 P.2d 310 (1990),   the court, seemingly in agreement with the recommendation of the PIK Committee that no instruction be   given to define “causation,” notes that the trial court’s use of the phrase “direct cause” needs no definition   and is not a difficult term for a jury to understand.      In Cullip v. Domann, 266 Kan. 550, 972 P.2d 776 (1999), the Supreme Court affirmed the trial   court’s decision to grant summary judgment to a juvenile who failed to warn the plaintiff that another   juvenile was not observing gun safety. The court held that the defendant’s failure to take a hunter safety   course as required by law was negligence per se, but stated, “Liability in damages cannot be predicated ona   violation of statute unless the breach of law is the proximate cause of the injury or damages, or substantially   contributes thereto.” Cullip at 555.      Proximate cause is almost, but not quite, obsolete as a consideration in negligence cases in Kansas.   In Reynolds v. Kansas Dept. of Transportation 273 Kan. 261, , 43 P.3d 799 (2002), the Supreme   Court stated, “[s]ince adoption of comparative negligence in 1974, Kansas courts compare the percentages   of fault of all alleged wrongdoers. K.S.A. 60-258a. Proximate cause is not an obsolete concept in Kansas   law, but when it has been mentioned by this court in recent years it typically has been in a criminal context   . ..With the adoption of comparative fault, Kansas has moved beyond the concept of proximate cause in   negligence.”      However, Phoenix-like, the concept regularly arises from its own ashes. In Hale v. Brown, 287 Kan.   320, 323, 197 P.3d 438 (2008), the Supreme Court said, “This court has continued, however, to adhere to   the common-law requirement of proximate cause.” See also Zimmerman v. Brown, 49 Kan. App. 2d 143,   306 P.3d 306, rev. denied 298 Kan. 1209 (2013); Miller v. Johnson, 295 Kan. 636, 289 P.3d 1098 (2012);   Deal v. Bowman, 286 Kan. 853, 188 P.3d 941 (2008); Esquivel v. Watters, 286 Kan. 292, 183 P.3d 847   (2008); Yount v. Diebert, 282 Kan. 619, 147 P.3d 1065 (2006); and D.W. v. Bliss, 279 Kan. 726, 112 P.3d   232 (2005).      In Drouhard-Nordhus v. Rosenquist, 301 Kan. 618, 345 P.3d 281 (2015), the Supreme Court upheld   a district court order granting summary judgment to a physician in a medical malpractice action. The court   specifically based its holding on the failure of the plaintiff to make a showing of proximate cause linking   the alleged medical malpractice to the claimed injury. See also Siruta v. Siruta, 301 Kan. 757, 766, 348   P.3d 549 (2015) (citing proximate cause as a necessary element of a prima facie case of negligence in a   wrongful death action).

Such acts   are known as concurrent causes. Such acts need not occur at the same time.   When concurrent negligent acts of two or more persons cause an injury, each   person is at fault.      Notes on Use      The Committee believes that the applicable instructions in Chapter 105 are normally sufficient and   that the above instruction should seldom be given.      Comment      In Cox v. Lesko, 263 Kan. 805, 953 P.2d 1033 (1998), the court held that a patient’s fault in failing   to undergo post-operative physical therapy could be compared with the malpractice of the physician in   performing the surgery. In view of the breadth of the concept of comparative fault illustrated by Cox v.   Lesko, it seems rarely useful for a jury in a negligence case to consider whether a cause is concurrent.     In Puckett v. Mt. Carmel Regional Med. Center, 290 Kan. 406, 228 P.3d 1048 (2010), a medical   malpractice case, the Supreme Court stated that a negligent health care provider cannot be held solely   liable for subsequent negligence of other treating health care providers. If successive negligent actions of   more than one health care provider combined to cause an injury, the liability of each care provider must be   allocated based on comparative fault.      2010      "      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 62.300'>  62.300</a>  Physician, Skill Required of   A person professing to practice surgery or the administering of medi...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.760'>  66.760</a>  Reprehensibility; Amplified   (Note: Because State Farm suggests that reprehensibility is the most ...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 62.400'>  62.400</a>  Attorney, Skill Required of   The initial requirement for establishing liability in a case of this ...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.750'>  66.750</a>  Punitive Damages; Amount; Guidelines   (Note: Georgia statutory law does not recognize guidelines f...</p><p><b>(97%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 66.770'>  66.770</a>  Limiting Instructions     (Note: Another facet of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v....</p></p>
