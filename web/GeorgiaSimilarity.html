    <h1>Georgia Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to run a similarities between jury instructions. The "base" jury instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive.
    The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. 
    Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. 
    Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared; both internally within the jury instruction and externally with a different jurisdiction's jury instruction.</p>

Where conflicts were found to exist among the   decisions of the various circuit courts of appeal interpreting the federal rules of evidence,      the General Assembly considered the decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . The             General Assembly is cognizant that there are many issues regarding evidence that are not   covered by the Federal Rules of Evidence and in those situations the former provisions of   Title 24 have been retained. Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the   General Assembly intends that the substantive law of evidence in Georgia as it existed on      December 31, 2012 be retained.” [emphasis added]             Consistent with the foregoing, the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee has reviewed   all old charges on evidence and made changes keeping in mind the new rules and added   other refinements we felt were needed. Some old charges were retained even where   underlying statutes have been repealed or replaced. In most such instances, it was felt the   old charge could do no harm. The committee has also taken some charges from the I 1th      Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions we felt were clearer and complied with Georgia Law.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#121.01'>121.01</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#121.08'>121.08</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#132.09'>132.09</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.20'>181.20</a> (97%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#121.88'>121.88</a> (97%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.005' href='# 00.005'></a> 00.005</h4><p>  (Civil): Before Introduction   of Evidence   (Note: Preliminary instructions are optional and are included in this charge book for use by   those judges who feel they would be helpful to jurors. Many judges use some form of   preliminary instructions because they feel it assists jurors in understanding their   responsibility and the order of trial proceedings.   Care should be taken to ensure that all parties are present during these and all jury      instructions unless the record shows a waiver. This practice has been approved by the      appellate courts in Bradham v. State, 148 Ga. App. 89[6] [1978], even in the absence of the   defendant, Oliver v. State, 168 Ga.

Testimony is the statements that you will hear made under oath from the witness(es).   Exhibits are documents, photos, or other items that will be admitted into evidence. You will   then have those exhibits with you in the jury room for use during your deliberations.     I caution you that what the lawyers say during this trial is not evidence. Nothing they   say in their opening statements or their arguments or at any other time during this trial is   evidence. Nor is anything I might do or say evidence in this case.     I have no leanings in this case whatsoever. My interest in this case is to see that it is   tried fairly for both parties and to see that it is tried according to the laws of the State of      Georgia and according to the constitutions of this state and of the United States.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.02'>101.02</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#102.03'>102.03</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.20'>181.20</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.12'>101.12</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.40'>181.40</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.030' href='# 00.030'></a> 00.030</h4><p> Parties (Optional)   You must consider this case as a lawsuit between persons of equal worth and equal standing   in the community and between persons holding the same or similar positions in life. All   persons stand equal before the law, and all persons are to be dealt with as equals in a court   of justice.

The plaintiff   must prove this case by what is known as a “preponderance of the evidence.”     The term “preponderance” means “greater weight,” and as it is used here,   “preponderance of the evidence” means “the greater weight of evidence upon the issues   involved.” The weight of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a   reasonable doubt. However, to be a preponderance, the weight of the evidence must be   sufficient to incline a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to   the other.     (Give the following portion of this charge if an affirmative defense is asserted:     The defendant has filed what is/are known as [an] affirmative defense[s] to the      claim[s] of the plaintiff, specifically [state the affirmative defense(s) asserted]. As to             that/those defense[s], the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of   the evidence.)   If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it would then   be your duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue.   (Note: The preceding paragraph has been disapproved by Dyer v. Souther, 274 Ga.   61 [2001].)     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#102.10'>102.10</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.05'>181.05</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#191.21'>191.21</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#130.22'>130.22</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#102.73'>102.73</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.050' href='# 00.050'></a> 00.050</h4><p> Credibility of Witnesses   The jury must determine the credibility, or believability, of the witnesses. Therefore, you   must determine which witness or witnesses you will believe and which you will not believe,   if there are any whom you do not believe.     In determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies and the credibility of      witnesses, you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case. You may consider      1) the witnesses’ manner of testifying,     2) their intelligence,     3) their means and opportunity for knowing the facts about which they testify,   4) the nature of the facts about which they testify,      5) the probability or improbability of their testimony,             6) their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and      7) their personal credibility as it appears from the trial.      It is your duty to determine what testimony is worthy of belief and what testimony   is not worthy of belief. You may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of   any witness.     You may also consider the number of witnesses, but the preponderance of evidence      does not necessarily lie with the party who has the greater number of witnesses.

During the course of this trial there may   be objections made by the lawyers and rulings made by the court. These objections and   rulings will involve the technical rules of evidence, and you should draw no inferences and   make no assumptions from either the lawyer’s objections or the court’s rulings. Evidence      that is not admitted because of an objection or other reason shall not be considered by you.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.02'>101.02</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#102.03'>102.03</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.20'>101.20</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#191.21'>191.21</a> (98%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.40'>181.40</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.080' href='# 00.080'></a> 00.080</h4><p> Trial Procedure   The procedure used in a civil trial is generally as follows:     First, the attorney for each side has the opportunity to address you in what is called   an opening statement. This opening statement itself is not evidence. Remember that what the   lawyers say is not evidence but rather is a preview or outline of what they expect the   evidence to be. Since the plaintiff has the burden of proof, the plaintiff goes first.     Following the opening statements, the plaintiff presents evidence; that is, the plaintiff   calls witnesses and introduces any exhibits. The defendant has the right to cross-examine   these witnesses. When the plaintiff has presented all of his/her evidence, the plaintiff will   rest his/her case.     The defendant then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means that the   defendant then calls witnesses and introduces exhibits. The plaintiff has the right to cross-      examine the defendant’s witnesses.              After all of the evidence has been presented, the attorneys have the opportunity to   make what is called a closing argument or a summation. At that time, the attorneys will   attempt to point out to you certain parts of the evidence that they think are favorable to their   position and try to persuade you to decide the case in their favor. Both sides have the   opportunity to make this closing argument.     Following the closing arguments, I will charge you more specifically on the law   directly applicable to this case. I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and   reach your verdict.     Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the   evidence. Do not jump to conclusions before all of the evidence is presented. Also, please   remember that during the course of this trial, it would be improper for you to discuss this   case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the case with you or in your presence or   hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in the jury room or elsewhere before      actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence of all twelve of you.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.02'>101.02</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#181.40'>181.40</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#101.30'>101.30</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#102.08'>102.08</a> (99%); <a href='KansasSimilarity.html#191.21'>191.21</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.090' href='# 00.090'></a> 00.090</h4><p> Note Taking by Jurors     Regarding juror note taking: I have asked the bailiff to provide you with pencils and note   pads for your use during trial. You may take notes, but you are not required to do so. If you   decide to take notes, please remember that note taking should not divert you from paying   full attention to the evidence and evaluating witness credibility. Your observations of the   witnesses during their testimony can be vital to your determination of the believability of   their testimony. The notes that you take are for your use only and are not to be shared with   anyone until you begin deliberation with your fellow jurors. Notes are not evidence, only   memory aids, and should not take precedence over your recollection. It is the duty of each   juror to recall the evidence, and while you may consider another juror’s notes to refresh your   memory, you should rely on your own recollection of the proceedings. Do not be influenced   by the notes of other jurors, unless their notes help you in determining your own   independent recollection. Notes are not entitled to any greater weight than the recollection or   impression of each juror as to what the evidence may have been. After the trial is over, the      notes will be collected and destroyed.             United States v. Rhodes, 631 F.2d 43 (5th Cir.) (1980)   United States v. D. R. McLean, 578 F.2d 64 (3rd Cir.)
