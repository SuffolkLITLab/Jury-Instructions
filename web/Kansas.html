<html><h4><a name='101.01' href='101.01'>101.01</a></h4><p>JURY HANDBOOK USAGE RECOMMENDED      The Committee has reorganized and updated the handbook for jurors   that follows as PIK 4 . The handbook is intended to provide basic   information about the jury trial process in an effort to anticipate and answer   many of the questions that prospective jurors often have. It can be mailed to   prospective jurors with their summons, handed to them as they arrive at the   courthouse, or the judge may choose to read all or parts of it to prospective   jurors before or during jury selection. However judges choose to approach   jury orientation and jury selection, the Committee simply recommends that   the handbook be utilized in some fashion.      When orienting or selecting a jury, the trial judge must take care to   be accurate when describing the law or trial procedure and to avoid any   comment(s) that might be perceived as indicating bias or a suggestion as to   how the judge would resolve any of the factual issues in the case.      Comment      A number of cases through the years have involved a claim of error predicated upon comments made   by the trial judge during jury orientation or selection. See State v. Reuter, 126 Kan. 565, 268 Pac. 845   (1928); State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.3d 139 (2001); State v. Plunkett, 257 Kan. 135, 891 P.2d 370   (1995).     The trial court’s jury orientation comments will be reviewed on appeal under the judicial misconduct   standard of review. It must affirmatively appear that the conduct was of such a nature as to prejudice   the substantial rights of the complaining party. State v. Nguyen, 251 Kan. 69, 833 P.2d 937, Syl. Į 4, 5   (1992).      2010      "       <h4><a name='101.02' href='101.02'>101.02</a></h4><p>HANDBOOK FOR JURORS      I. The Importance of Jury Service      Jury service is a serious obligation of all qualified citizens, and is a vital   part of our American system of justice. By carrying out their task well and   faithfully, jurors help resolve controversies, enforce our laws, and preserve   the legal rights of our citizens.      II. Excuses From Jury Duty      Excuses from jury duty should be sought only for reasons of compelling   personal hardship or because requiring jury service would be contrary to the   public health, safety or welfare. Although jury service can be inconvenient or   financially burdensome, experience has shown that most jurors feel that any   such inconvenience or personal expense is far outweighed by the value and   importance of jury service to the community at large. If you believe that you   cannot or should not be required to serve as a juror in this case, you will have   the opportunity to state your reasons to the judge.      III. Composition of Jury Panel      Parties have the right to juries selected from a fair cross section of the   county in which the court convenes. As such, prospective jurors are selected   at random from county voter registration records or lists of licensed drivers   or persons holding state-issued identification cards who reside in the county,   and/or census records.      IV. Civil and Criminal Cases      In civil cases, parties generally claim that their person or property has   been injured or damaged by the wrongful act of another. Money is normally   sought as compensation for the claimed injury. Parties in civil cases may also   seek a court order establishing or enforcing contractual or other legal rights   or obligations. Examples of civil cases would be motor vehicle accident cases   or real estate contract disputes. The person bringing the suit is the plaintiff,   and the party being sued is the defendant.      Criminal cases are those in which the plaintiff is generally the State of   Kansas and is represented by the prosecuting attorney who starts the case   by filing a complaint alleging that the defendant has violated the law in      2016                 "      some respect. The defendant is presumed to be innocent of all charges. The   prosecutor must establish the defendant’s guilt by proof beyond a reasonable   doubt. The defendant is not required to present evidence.      V. Role of the Attorneys, Judge, and Jury      Attorneys have the obligation to represent their clients in a competent   and professional manner. They present evidence to support the claims of   their clients. They may challenge or question the evidence presented by other   parties to the lawsuit. At times they will object to certain evidence offered by   the other parties if they believe that such evidence should not be admitted.      The judge has the duty to decide what evidence may be received and   considered by the jury; to control the progress of the trial; to rule on all   questions of law; and to instruct the jury on the law that applies to a given   case.      The jury has the duty to listen closely to all of the evidence presented by   any party; to determine from that evidence what the facts of the case are; to   apply those facts to the law as instructed by the judge; and thus to arrive at a   verdict in the case.      At times during the trial the judge and attorneys may discuss matters   at the bench or otherwise outside your view or hearing. These conferences   are necessary for various reasons, such as to resolve issues concerning the   admissibility of certain evidence. Judges try to keep these conferences as few   and brief as possible.      VI. Jury Selection Process      On the first day of trial, prospective jurors are given an oath to honestly   answer questions concerning their qualifications to sit as jurors in the case.   This questioning process is called voir dire, a French term meaning “to speak   the truth.” The questioning is done by the judge or by the attorneys, and   sometimes both, and is intended to determine if prospective jurors have any   personal interest in or knowledge of the case; whether they are related to or   personally acquainted with the parties or their attorneys; or whether they, for   whatever reason, have a personal feeling or bias that would make it difficult   for them to be fair and impartial to both sides of the case.      During the questioning of prospective jurors, a person may be challenged   for cause if it is shown that he or she would not be an appropriate juror for   the particular case. The judge will excuse the person from the panel if the   cause given is deemed sufficient. Once the questioning of prospective jurors   is complete, the parties will then exercise a certain number of challenges for   which no cause is necessary. These are known as peremptory challenges. The      2010      "      2010      peremptory challenge is a legal right long recognized as a means of giving both   sides some choice in the make-up of the jury. Jurors should understand that   being removed from the jury panel for cause or by a peremptory challenge is   no reflection upon their ability or integrity.      The judge may also decide to select one or more alternate jurors to serve   in the place of regular jurors who become unable to fulfill their duties at some   point during the trial. Alternate jurors may be selected at the same time the   regular jurors are selected, or after the regular jury has been selected. Alternate   jurors are selected in the same manner, and have the same qualifications and   duties as regular jurors.      VIL. Stages of the Trial      A. Opening Statement. Once the jury has been selected, the attorneys are   entitled to make opening statements outlining what they believe the   evidence in the case will be. These statements are intended to help the   jury in following and understanding the evidence as it is presented.      B. Presentation of Evidence. Following opening statements, the parties   then present the testimony of witnesses and other forms of evidence   in an effort to prove their claims in the lawsuit, or in an effort to   disprove the claims of the other party. Defendants are not required to   present evidence.      C. Instructions By the Judge. Once the parties have presented all of   their evidence, the judge will then prepare and read to the jury a set of   instructions outlining the law that applies to the particular case. The   jurors will take these instructions with them to the jury room to serve   as their guide in the deliberation process.      D. Final Arguments. Following the reading of the jury instructions by   the judge, the attorneys are then entitled to make final arguments in   which they state what they believe the evidence has been and how   the evidence should be viewed and applied in light of the judge’s   instructions.      E. Deliberation and Verdict. The jury will first select one of its members   as presiding juror to sign the verdict form and to speak for the jury   in open court. In a criminal case, the jury’s verdict as to any crime   charged must be unanimous, that is, all jurors must agree upon   the verdict. In a civil case, the agreement of 10 out of 12 jurors is   sufficient.                            VIII. Courtroom Etiquette      The courtroom is a place where all persons should conduct themselves   with dignity, courtesy and proper respect for the court and everyone present.   Noisy or disruptive conduct is not allowed. The clothing worn by jurors may   be casual but should be appropriate for the serious business of the court.   Hats and caps should be removed upon entering the courtroom. If cellular   phones are allowed in the courthouse, they must be turned off at all times   in the courtroom. Newspapers, magazines, books, etc. should be put away.   Quiet and close attention to the proceedings at hand is the order of the day.      IX. Conduct of the Jury During Trial      Each juror must pay close attention to the testimony and keep an open   mind throughout the trial. Jurors can and should use the knowledge they   possess in common with persons in general. Jurors are encouraged to use   their common sense.      Until all of the evidence has been presented and the final instructions   given by the judge, jurors must not discuss the case among themselves or with   anyone else, including anyone outside the courthouse. If anyone attempts to   talk with a juror about the case, the juror should tell this person that such   conversation is not proper and should cease. The juror should also report the   matter to the bailiff at the earliest opportunity.      Jurors must receive all of their information about the case from the trial   itself, and must not rely on any other source of information. Jurors must not   search for, read or listen to any information from the internet relating in any   way to the case. Jurors must avoid listening to, reading or viewing any media   coverage of the case. If during the trial a juror learns some information about   the case outside the trial, the juror should inform the judge. He or she must   not mention any such information to other jurors. Jurors must never inspect   the scene where the events occurred. If such an inspection is necessary, the   judge will have the jurors go as a group to the scene.      Once the case has been submitted to the jury for deliberation of a verdict,   jurors should freely exchange their views and should give proper consideration   to the views of other jurors. No juror is required to abandon any opinion   which the juror believes is correct, but jurors should be willing to change   their opinion if they become convinced by other jurors that such opinion is   not correct.      "      2010      "      2010      X. Accommodating the Needs and Concerns of Jurors      Understanding that jury service can at times be a burden, the judge and   staff will make every effort to minimize any inconveniences. Depending on   the particular county in which the case is handled, information regarding   parking, dining establishments, cellular phone use, disability accommodations,   etc. may be separately provided. Although some cases are shorter in duration   and some can be much longer, the average jury trial takes 2-3 days. Except in   very rare instances, you will be allowed to return home each evening.      During the trial, if you cannot hear the proceeding, or need to take a   restroom break, just raise your hand and let the judge know. If you have   other concerns regarding your comfort or convenience or that of other jurors,   do not hesitate to express that concern to the bailiff during a break in the   proceedings.

Whether you do so is entirely up to you. However, do not allow the taking of   notes to distract you from listening attentively to the testimony of a witness.      You may use your notes to refresh your memory as you deliberate.   However, your deliberations must be based upon the collective memory and   recollection of the entire jury as to the evidence admitted. Notes should be   used only as an aid to this function and not as a substitute.      You must not remove any of your notes from the courthouse. At the   beginning of a recess give your packet of notes to the bailiff. Your notes will   be returned to you when court reconvenes.      At the conclusion of the trial, all notes must be given to the bailiff for   immediate destruction.      Comment      The court may wish to consider the anticipated length of the trial, the technical nature of the subjects   about which the witnesses will testify, and the amount of detail that must be sifted through by the jurors in   order to be competent fact finders.     Note taking by jurors is a matter of “sound judicial discretion.” State v. Jackson, 201 Kan. 795, 799,   443 P.2d 279 (1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 908, 89 S. Ct. 1019, 22 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1969) overruled on other   grounds in State v. Mims, 220 Kan. 726, 556 P.2d 387 (1976). A more comprehensive review of the subject   is contained in 14 A.L.R. 3d 831.     Permitting note taking without having first given the note taking instruction will be judged according   to the “clearly erroneous” standard of review. State v. Diggs, 272 Kan. 349, 8, 34 P.3d 63 (2001).      2010      "      2018      <h4><a name='101.12' href='101.12'>101.12</a></h4><p>INSTRUCTION FOR IMPANELED JURORS      Now that you have been chosen as jurors for this trial, you are required   to decide this case only on the evidence admitted. At the end of the case, I   will instruct you on the law that you must apply to the evidence in order to   reach a verdict. For your verdict to be fair, you must not be exposed to any   information about the case, the law, or any of the issues involved in this trial   beyond that which is admitted during the trial.      Do not seek information about the case beyond what you see and   hear in this courtroom. Do not use any printed or electronic sources to get   information about this case or any of the issues involved. These sources   include the internet, reference books, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines,   television, radio, computers, smartphones, or any other electronic device. You   must not do any personal investigation about the issues, including visiting any   of the places involved in this case, or use Internet maps or Google Earth to   examine the scene. You cannot talk to any possible witnesses, or create your   own demonstrations or re-enactments of the events which are the subject of   this case.      Do not communicate with anyone about this case or your jury service,   and do not allow anyone to communicate with you. In particular, you may not   talk about the case by using cell phones, emails, text messages, tweets, blogs,   chat rooms, comments or other postings on Facebook or any other website.   You may notify your family and your employer that you have been seated as a   juror in the case. But, if you are asked or approached by anyone, in any way,   about your jury service or anything about this case, you must respond that   you have been ordered not to discuss the matter. You should then report the   contact to the bailiff of the court as soon as possible.      The court recognizes that these rules and restrictions may affect activities   that you would consider to be normal and harmless. However, the law requires   these restrictions to ensure the parties have a fair trial based on the evidence   that each party has had an opportunity to produce and discuss.      Any juror who violates these rules and restrictions jeopardizes the   fairness of these proceedings. Violations may be punished as contempt of   court. In addition, a mistrial could result, causing the entire trial process to   start over. If you become aware that a juror has done something that violates   these instructions, you must report that to the court.      These rules and restrictions remain in effect until you have been   discharged from your jury service.                  "      Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction be read to the jury at the start of every trial. The   proliferation of electronic devices giving unlimited access to outside-the-courtroom sources of information,   human and digital, creates a very real possibility of juror misconduct and resulting mistrials.       2016      "      2012      <h4><a name='101.20' href='101.20'>101.20</a></h4><p>QUALIFYING THE JURY      I.

II. PURPOSE OF VOIR DIRE      As prospective jurors you will be called and questioned so that the Court   may determine your qualifications to serve in this case. The Court and the   attorneys conduct this examination to obtain a fair and impartial jury and   not to pry into your personal affairs. Because this is an important part of the   trial, the law requires that prospective jurors be sworn before questions are   asked. The Clerk will administer the oath.      HI.

Comment     Kansas Statutes recognizes the right of participation in this examination by the Court and by counsel.   The Committee believes the following are not proper areas for examination:     1. Questions previously asked by Court or counsel, and answered.     2. Questions touching upon anticipated instructions.                  "      3. Questions touching upon the verdict to be returned when those questions are based upon     hypothetical facts and situations.     4. Questions that are in substance arguments of the case.     Additionally, the Committee believes that voir dire is best conducted when questions are not asked   relative to data available from jury information sheets obtainable from the clerk and when collective   questions are used as fully as practicable. Such restrictions as those found above may be made known to   counsel by rule or informal statement.       2012      "      2016      <h4><a name='101.30' href='101.30'>101.30</a></h4><p>RECESS INSTRUCTIONS      During this recess you must not talk about this case with any other person   nor allow any other person to discuss the case with you.

Comment      The trial judge should admonish the jury pursuant to K.S.A. 60-248(d) whenever the jury is permitted   to separate during the trial. But prejudicial error will not be presumed from such failure in the absence of a   showing of substantial prejudicial misconduct on the part of the jurors resulting from a failure to give the   statutory admonishment. The party claiming prejudice has the burden of proof. Hawkinson v. Bennett, 265   Kan. 564, 566, 962 P.2d 445 (1998).

PREFACE TO PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS      Members of the Jury, I will now give you some preliminary instructions   on the law that I believe will be helpful to you in listening to the evidence in   the case and understanding what issues you will be asked to decide at the end   of the case. The instructions that I will give you now are not the complete   instructions, and if the final instructions are different from these preliminary   instructions, it is the final instructions that you must follow in reaching your   verdict.      It sometimes happens that the attorneys and I believe at the beginning of   the case that certain matters will be submitted to you for decision at the end   of the case but the evidence is different from what the parties expected, or a   party decides to abandon a claim or defense. That is why the final instructions   are sometimes different from the preliminary instructions. Therefore, it is   important that you understand that these instructions are only preliminary,   and are meant to help you in listening to the evidence in the case.      B. IF JURY WAS GIVEN PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS      As you remember, I gave you some general instructions before the   attorneys presented any evidence. These preliminary instructions were meant   to help you in listening to the evidence in the case and understanding what   issues you would have to decide to reach your verdict.      The instructions that I am giving you now are the complete and final   instructions. It is these instructions on the law that you must use during   your deliberations. If the final instructions are different from the preliminary   instructions, you should disregard the preliminary instructions and follow   these instructions.      The instructions are in writing and you will have them in the jury room   for your use during deliberations.      Notes on Use   K.S.A. 60-251 provides that the court must instruct the jury at the close of the evidence before   argument. It also gives the trial court the discretion to give the jury instructions at any other time.      This provision creates a great opportunity for the trial judge to assist jurors in understanding their   duty as well as some of the general rules they will use in deciding the case. The Committee recommends      2020      "      2010      that the trial court consider giving some of the basic instructions for considering evidence, the issues and   burden of proof instruction, and any of the instructions on the substantive law regarding duties that are   applicable to the case. In a comparative fault case, the instruction on comparative fault and the jury’s duty   to apportion fault should always be given as a preliminary instruction.     If the judge decides to give preliminary instructions, Part A of this instruction should be given as a   preface to the preliminary instructions, then Part B should be included as part of the final instructions.     Although the Kansas Code of Civil Procedure does not require that the jury be given written   instructions, the Committee believes that the jury should always be given written copies of the final   instructions for use during deliberations. Giving the jury written copies of the final instructions does not   substitute for the court’s duty to give oral instructions—the court should always give the final instructions   orally before final arguments.                  "      <h4><a name='102.09' href='102.09'>102.09</a></h4><p>FORM OF PRONOUN—SINGULAR AND PLURAL      Whenever the word “he” is used in these instructions, you may consider   it as applying equally to a woman or an entity, such as a corporation. Also,   the use of the singular of a word may be taken equally to mean the plural.      Note on Use      It is better if a judge adopts the correct pronouns in the body of his or her instructions so that this   instruction becomes unnecessary.       2010      "      2012      B. BURDEN OF PROOF DEFINED      <h4><a name='102.10' href='102.10'>102.10</a></h4><p>MEANING OF BURDEN OF PROOF      Burden of proof means burden of persuasion. A party that has the burden   to prove a claim must persuade you that the claim is more probably true than   not true. In deciding whether this burden has been met, you must consider   all admitted evidence, whether presented by plaintiff or defendant.      Notes on Use      A court should not give this instruction in a land condemnation case. City of Wichita v. Jennings, 199   Kan. 621, 433 P.2d 351 (1967). For a discussion as to the issues in a condemnation suit requiring a burden   of proof instruction, see Comment to PIK 4" , Burden of Proof.      Comment      For a case in which the trial court was held to have properly determined that the burden of proof as to   one of the issues involved had been sustained as a matter of law and consequently was not to be submitted   to the jury, see Thompson v. Norman, 198 Kan. 436, 445, 424 P.2d 593 (1967). The court discussed an   objection that the trial court refused to instruct that the plaintiff could not recover if the evidence was evenly   balanced. Apparently, the defendant had argued that refusal to give this instruction resulted in placing the   burden of proof on him. The objection was held to be unfounded on the basis that the instructions, taken as   a whole, adequately covered the burden of proof as to all issues.                  "      <h4><a name='102.11' href='102.11'>102.11</a></h4><p>BURDEN OF PROOF—CLEAR AND CONVINCING      Burden of proof means burden of persuasion. _Jnsert name of party _ has   the burden to prove _ insert claim_. _Insert name of party must persuade   you of the truth of that claim by clear and convincing evidence. In determining   whether _ insert name of party _ has met this burden you must consider all   admitted evidence, whether presented by plaintiff or defendant.      Evidence is clear and convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact   asserted is highly probable.      Notes on Use      This instruction is to be used when a party has the obligation to prove a fact by clear and convincing   evidence. When the burden of proof of other facts in the case is by a preponderance of the evidence, this   instruction should be given along with PIK 4" , Meaning of Burden of Proof. It should be modified   to make clear the issues of fact to which each burden of proof applies.      Comment      See K.S.A. 60-401(d). A higher and more satisfactory character of proof is required to establish that   an instrument or conveyance is not what it purports to be than is necessary in ordinary civil cases. See   Winston v. Burnell, 44 Kan. 367, 24 P. 477 (1890).     The definition of clear and convincing evidence is based on the holding in Jn re B.D.-Y., 286 Kan.   686, 187 P.3d 594 (2008), which disapproved all contrary definitions in prior opinions and in former PIK   4" .     For standard of proof required in action to cancel oil and gas lease, see Jackman v. Lawrence Drilling   & Development Co., 106 Kan. 59, 187 P. 258 (1920).      For the standard of proof required of one who asserts fraud, see Hoch v. Hoch, 187 Kan. 730, 359   P.2d 839 (1961). See PIK 4" , Fraud—Elements.     Clear and convincing evidence is necessary for third party beneficiaries to prove that testators had   an oral contract between themselves to leave their property to the beneficiaries upon the death of the last   testator. See In re Estate of Stratmann, 248 Kan. 197, 202, 806 P.2d 459 (1991).      Claimants are required to prove a claim for retaliatory discharge by clear and convincing evidence.   Ortega v. IBP, Inc., 255 Kan. 513, 874 P.2d 1188 (1994).       2012      "       C.

In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction be given in every jury case.   See PIK—Criminal 4" 51.060.      Comment      The use of a previous version of this instruction was approved in State v. Sanders, 224 Kan. 138,   578 P.2d 702 (1978). In that case, the instruction was combined with PIK—Criminal 52.09, Credibility of   Witnesses, and the substance of PIK 2.24 (First Edition, 1966) [now PIK 4" ].      2016       "      <h4><a name='102.21' href='102.21'>102.21</a></h4><p>EVALUATION OF DEPOSITION EVIDENCE      Comment      This instruction has been deleted and is now incorporated in PIK 4" , Evaluation of Evidence,   Including Depositions.       2010      "       <h4><a name='102.22' href='102.22'>102.22</a></h4><p>WITNESS NEED NOT BE BELIEVED      Comment      It is recommended that no instruction of this type be given. Determination of credibility of witnesses   is solely within the province of the jury and it is superfluous to inform them that certain witnesses need not   be believed. The standards for assessing credibility of witnesses are adequately set forth in PIK 4" ,   Credibility of Witnesses.      2010       "      <h4><a name='102.23' href='102.23'>102.23</a></h4><p>WITNESS TESTIFYING FALSELY      Comment      The Committee recommends that no instruction be given relating to testimony that may be false.   Credibility of witnesses is solely within the province of the jury and our Supreme Court has approved of   eliminating instructions “which focus on the credibility of certain testimony.” State v. Willis, 240 Kan. 580,   587, 731 P.2d 287 (1987). The matter is appropriately left to the closing arguments of counsel.     While some decisions have held the giving of an instruction relating to false testimony was not error,   e.g., Cleveland v. Wong, 237 Kan. 410, 424, 701 P.2d 1301 (1985), the Committee finds no recent cases   where the giving of such an instruction was encouraged.       2010      "       <h4><a name='102.24' href='102.24'>102.24</a></h4><p>PARTY COMPETENT AS A WITNESS      Comment      The Committee recommends that no instruction on “party competent as a witness” be given.      2010                   "      <h4><a name='102.30' href='102.30'>102.30</a></h4><p>IMPEACHMENT      In deciding the weight and credit you will give to the testimony of a   witness, you may consider, along with all the other evidence, all evidence that   affects the credibility of the witness, including:      [Evidence of prior conduct of the witness.]      [Evidence that on some former occasion the witness [(made a statement)   (acted in a manner) (testified)| inconsistent with testimony the witness gave in   this case.]      [Evidence that the reputation of the witness for (honesty) (veracity)   (honesty or veracity) is bad.]      [Evidence of (the interest the witness has in the result of the trial) (reasons   the witness might favor one party over another).|      [Evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime involving   dishonesty or false statement. |      [You may consider this evidence only as it affects the credibility of the   witness and may not consider it for other purposes.]      Notes on Use      When PIK 4" , Credibility of Witnesses, is given, it is generally unnecessary to give this   instruction. See PIK—Criminal 4" 51.220, in which the Committee recommends that no separate instruction   regarding impeachment be given in criminal cases because the instruction on Credibility of Witnesses   provides the jury adequate guidance. Moreover, in instances where evidence is admissible for one purpose,   e.g. impeachment, but is inadmissible for some other purpose, the appropriate time to give an instruction   limiting the jury’s use of the evidence is when the evidence is received. See K.S.A. 60-404, which codifies   the contemporaneous objection rule, and K.S.A. 60-406, which requires the judge “upon request” to   “restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.”     The final paragraph of the instruction should not be given regarding evidence that is admissible both   for impeachment and for other purposes. For example, prior inconsistent statements of testifying witnesses   ordinarily may also be used under the hearsay exception in K.S.A. 60-460(a) to prove the truth of the   facts asserted in the statement. Prior inconsistent statements of parties, including those in depositions or   answers to interrogatories, may also be used as substantive evidence under the party admissions exception   in K.S.A. 60-460(g). Likewise, there may be instances in which prior convictions involving dishonesty or   false statement may be used not only for impeachment but also for a substantive purpose under K.S.A. 60-   455.      2016      "      2010      Comment      As to evidence generally affecting credibility, see K.S.A. 60-420 and 60-422(c), (d); inconsistent   statements, see K.S.A. 60-422(b); depositions, see K.S.A. 60-232; interrogatories, see K.S.A. 60-233; and   crimes, see K.S.A. 60-421.     For rules as to scope of cross-examination affecting credibility, see Sanders v. Sitton, 179 Kan. 118,   292 P.2d 1099 (1956); State, ex rel. Emery v. Christensen, 132 Kan. 192, 294 P. 892 (1931).     The admissibility of evidence of a conviction is determined by whether the crime involves dishonesty   or false statement and not upon the penalty imposed or whether the crime is a felony or a misdemeanor. In   Tucker v. Lower, 200 Kan. 1, 434 P.2d 320 (1967), larceny and receiving stolen property were held to be   crimes involving dishonesty or false statement, and drunkenness, reckless driving, allowing an unauthorized   person to drive, and having an open bottle in a car were held not to be crimes involving dishonesty or false   statement.                  "      <h4><a name='102.40' href='102.40'>102.40</a></h4><p>LIMITED ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE AS TO   ONE PARTY OR PURPOSE      Whenever any evidence has been admitted only (against one party) (for   one purpose) you should not consider it (against any other party) (for any other      purpose).      Notes on Use      This written instruction should be given even though the court restricted the scope of consideration   at the time evidence was admitted.      Comment      As to the obligation to instruct, see K.S.A. 60-406.     When evidence is introduced for a limited purpose, the trial court should explain the limitation to   the jury and limit its application to that purpose. See State v. Kidwell, 199 Kan. 752, 434 P.2d 316 (1967)   (Citing PIK 2.40 [now PIK 4" )).     The substance of this instruction is set out, applied, and approved in Howard v. Stoughton, 199 Kan.   787, 433 P.2d 567 (1967).       2010      "      2016      <h4><a name='102.50' href='102.50'>102.50</a></h4><p>EXPERT WITNESS      Certain testimony has been given in this case by experts. Experts   are persons who, from experience, education or training have specialized   knowledge on matters not common to people in general. The law permits   experts to give their opinions about such matters. The testimony of experts   is to be considered like any other testimony and is to be evaluated by the   same tests. You should consider it in connection with all the other facts and   circumstances. You should give it the weight and credit you determine are   appropriate.      Notes on Use      If this instruction is given, it should follow PIK 4" , Credibility of Witnesses.      Comment      See K.S.A. 60-456. A prior version of this instruction was held to be a correct statement of the law   in English Village Properties, Inc. v. Boettcher & Lieurance Constr. Co., 7 Kan. App. 2d 307, 314, 640 P.2d   1282 (1982).     Although the Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged a trend away from instructions that focus on the   credibility of certain witnesses, State v. Adams, 292 Kan. 151, 6, 254 P.3d 515 (2011), held it was   not error to add the prior version of this instruction to the general instructions on witness credibility in PIK   Crim. 3d 52.09 [now PIK—Criminal 4" 51.060]. Doing so discouraged jurors from being overly impressed   by the expertise and official positions of prosecution experts who were not opposed by a defense expert.

Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction should seldom be given because these matters   would be addressed in closing argument.      Comment      The cases addressing this presumption involve knowledge or information that the party himself had   but did not disclose. In Evenson Trucking Co. v. Aranda, 280 Kan. 821, 127 P.3d 292 (2006), Aranda’s   failure to present a receipt he claimed existed “could create a presumption that no such evidence existed, or   was adverse to him.” In Blackburn v. Colvin, 191 Kan. 239, 380 P.2d 432 (1963), there was evidence that   Colvin had created a dangerous condition on his property but Colvin didn’t take the stand and deny it. The   court concluded that the failure of a party to throw light upon an issue particularly within his knowledge   raises a presumption that the concealed information is unfavorable to him. In Jn re Estate of Grisell, 176   Kan. 209, 270 P.2d 285 (1954), one of the opponents of a will testified and did not deny key evidence, the   truth of which he would certainly know. The court found the failure to deny raised the presumption that his   evidence on the subject would be unfavorable to his position. In Henks v. Panning, 175 Kan. 424, 264 P.2d   483 (1953), the defendants did not testify and, because they had within their own knowledge certain facts   that went unexplained, the presumption that their testimony would not have been favorable to their position   was invoked. In Donley v. Amerada Petroleum Corp., 152 Kan. 518, 106 P.2d 652 (1940), a corporation   failed to put on evidence of how long it had been emptying salt water into a creek, a subject that the court   found to be peculiarly within the corporation’s knowledge, and the presumption was therefore raised that   the information was unfavorable to the corporation.     Although the preceding cases address the issue of the presumption, in none of these cases does it   appear that any instruction regarding the presumption was given to the jury.

Notes on Use      If there is an issue as to whether the mail was properly addressed, stamped, or deposited, the   instruction should be: “If you are persuaded that mail was properly addressed, stamped, and deposited in   the United States mails, you must presume that it was delivered to the addressee unless you are persuaded   by the evidence that it was not delivered.”      2010                 "      <h4><a name='103.01' href='103.01'>103.01</a></h4><p>NEGLIGENCE DEFINED      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to   do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      Notes on Use      “Guilt” or “guilty of negligence” should not be used in a civil case.   This definition of negligence is applicable when the standard of care or duty is ordinary or reasonable   care. For other standards of care, the breach of which constitutes negligence, see:   PIK 4" -, , , Professional Negligence   PIK 4" -, Products Liability   PIK 4" -, FELA   PIK 4" -, Miscellaneous—Common Carriers   If negligence of a child is an issue, see PIK 4" , Negligence of Children, and PIK 4" ,   Comparative Fault Theory and Effect—Children.   In a comparative fault case, see PIK 4" , Comparative Fault Theory and Effect.      Comment      The general definition of negligence “is not designed as a specific rule where other standards of care,   i.e., products liability, malpractice, etc., apply.” Akins v. Hamblin, 237 Kan. 742, 747, 703 P.2d 771 (1985).   As a general rule, the presence or absence of negligence in any degree is not subject to determination by the   court on summary judgment. Such a determination should be left to the trier of fact. Only when reasonable   minds could not reach differing conclusions from the same evidence may the issue be decided as a question   of law. Gruhin v. City of Overland Park, 17 Kan. App. 2d 388, 836 P.2d 1222 (1992).      In unique cases where the activities in question are addressed by published industry standards that   are recognized as authoritative, the trial court may need to allow evidence of and instruct the jury as to   the relevant industry standards so as to enable the jury to evaluate the degree of care owed by sponsors or   participants in such activities. See e.g., Pullen v. West, 278 Kan. 183, 6, 92 P.3d 584 (2004), a case   involving the discharge of commercial fireworks at a private Fourth of July party. In addition, the trial court   may also need to allow appropriate expert testimony as to which of such standards apply to the unique facts   of the case. /d. at 210.      2010      "      2010      <h4><a name='103.02' href='103.02'>103.02</a></h4><p>NEGLIGENCE OF CHILDREN      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care.

Under such circumstances, neither this instruction nor PIK 4" ,   Comparative Fault Theory and Effect—Children, should be given.     As to the standard of conduct required of a child driving an automobile, authority is divided, but   one modern view is that where a child engages in an activity which is normally undertaken by adults, and   for which adult qualifications are required, the child is required to exercise that degree of care ordinarily   expected of an adult. See Age of minor operator of automobile or other motor-powered vehicle or craft as   affecting primary or contributory negligence, 97 A.L.R. 2d 872. Kansas appears to have held to the contrary   in Harvey v. Cole, 159 Kan. 239, 153 P.2d 916 (1944) (disapproved in Williams v. Esaw, 214 Kan. 658,   522 P.2d 950 (1974)). In Allen v. Ellis, 191 Kan. 311, 317, 380 P.2d 408 (1963), however, the Kansas court   decided that “There is nothing in the Uniform Operators’ and Chauffeurs’ License Act.... that makes any   exception to the standard of care and caution required as between minors and adults.”                            "      <h4><a name='103.03' href='103.03'>103.03</a></h4><p>WANTON CONDUCT DEFINED      Wanton conduct is doing something knowing that it is dangerous, and   either being completely indifferent to the danger or recklessly disregarding   the danger.      Notes on Use      A definition of wanton conduct will be required when punitive damages are claimed based on   wantonness. Folks v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 243 Kan. 57, 74, 755 P.2d 1319 (1988), overruled on   other grounds, York v. Intrust Bank, 265 Kan. 271, 962 P.2d 405 (1998); Lutz v. Independent Construction   Co., 183 Kan. 798, 332 P.2d 269 (1958). See PIK 4"  on punitive damages.      2020      "       <h4><a name='103.04' href='103.04'>103.04</a></h4><p>WILLFUL CONDUCT DEFINED      Willful conduct is intentionally or purposefully doing wrong or causing   injury to another.      Notes on Use      For authority, see Anderson v. White, 210 Kan. 18, 499 P.2d 1056 (1972).      Although the words “willful and wanton” are often used together, the Committee is of the opinion   that willful conduct is different than wanton conduct, and that a separate instruction is justified.      2012      "      <h4><a name='103.05' href='103.05'>103.05</a></h4><p>MALICE DEFINED      Malice is the intent to do harm without any reasonable justification or   excuse.      Comment      In TH. and C.C. v. University of Kansas Hosp. Auth., 53 Kan. App. 2d 332, 388 P.3d 181 (2017), a   medical malpractice case, the court cited this instruction with approval.      2018      "       2010      <h4><a name='103.06' href='103.06'>103.06</a></h4><p>NUISANCE DEFINED      A nuisance is a condition created or maintained that unreasonably   interferes with the personal rights or property rights of another and that   causes harm, inconvenience, or damage.

In Southgate Bank v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland, 14 Kan. App. 2d 454, 794 P.2d 310 (1990),   the court, seemingly in agreement with the recommendation of the PIK Committee that no instruction be   given to define “causation,” notes that the trial court’s use of the phrase “direct cause” needs no definition   and is not a difficult term for a jury to understand.      In Cullip v. Domann, 266 Kan. 550, 972 P.2d 776 (1999), the Supreme Court affirmed the trial   court’s decision to grant summary judgment to a juvenile who failed to warn the plaintiff that another   juvenile was not observing gun safety. The court held that the defendant’s failure to take a hunter safety   course as required by law was negligence per se, but stated, “Liability in damages cannot be predicated ona   violation of statute unless the breach of law is the proximate cause of the injury or damages, or substantially   contributes thereto.” Cullip at 555.      Proximate cause is almost, but not quite, obsolete as a consideration in negligence cases in Kansas.   In Reynolds v. Kansas Dept. of Transportation 273 Kan. 261, , 43 P.3d 799 (2002), the Supreme   Court stated, “[s]ince adoption of comparative negligence in 1974, Kansas courts compare the percentages   of fault of all alleged wrongdoers. K.S.A. 60-258a. Proximate cause is not an obsolete concept in Kansas   law, but when it has been mentioned by this court in recent years it typically has been in a criminal context   . ..With the adoption of comparative fault, Kansas has moved beyond the concept of proximate cause in   negligence.”      However, Phoenix-like, the concept regularly arises from its own ashes. In Hale v. Brown, 287 Kan.   320, 323, 197 P.3d 438 (2008), the Supreme Court said, “This court has continued, however, to adhere to   the common-law requirement of proximate cause.” See also Zimmerman v. Brown, 49 Kan. App. 2d 143,   306 P.3d 306, rev. denied 298 Kan. 1209 (2013); Miller v. Johnson, 295 Kan. 636, 289 P.3d 1098 (2012);   Deal v. Bowman, 286 Kan. 853, 188 P.3d 941 (2008); Esquivel v. Watters, 286 Kan. 292, 183 P.3d 847   (2008); Yount v. Diebert, 282 Kan. 619, 147 P.3d 1065 (2006); and D.W. v. Bliss, 279 Kan. 726, 112 P.3d   232 (2005).      In Drouhard-Nordhus v. Rosenquist, 301 Kan. 618, 345 P.3d 281 (2015), the Supreme Court upheld   a district court order granting summary judgment to a physician in a medical malpractice action. The court   specifically based its holding on the failure of the plaintiff to make a showing of proximate cause linking   the alleged medical malpractice to the claimed injury. See also Siruta v. Siruta, 301 Kan. 757, 766, 348   P.3d 549 (2015) (citing proximate cause as a necessary element of a prima facie case of negligence in a   wrongful death action).      "      2016      "       <h4><a name='104.02' href='104.02'>104.02</a></h4><p>CONCURRENT CAUSES      An injury may be caused by more than one negligent act. Such acts   are known as concurrent causes. Such acts need not occur at the same time.   When concurrent negligent acts of two or more persons cause an injury, each   person is at fault.      Notes on Use      The Committee believes that the applicable instructions in Chapter 105 are normally sufficient and   that the above instruction should seldom be given.      Comment      In Cox v. Lesko, 263 Kan. 805, 953 P.2d 1033 (1998), the court held that a patient’s fault in failing   to undergo post-operative physical therapy could be compared with the malpractice of the physician in   performing the surgery. In view of the breadth of the concept of comparative fault illustrated by Cox v.   Lesko, it seems rarely useful for a jury in a negligence case to consider whether a cause is concurrent.     In Puckett v. Mt. Carmel Regional Med. Center, 290 Kan. 406, 228 P.3d 1048 (2010), a medical   malpractice case, the Supreme Court stated that a negligent health care provider cannot be held solely   liable for subsequent negligence of other treating health care providers. If successive negligent actions of   more than one health care provider combined to cause an injury, the liability of each care provider must be   allocated based on comparative fault.      2010      "      <h4><a name='104.03' href='104.03'>104.03</a></h4><p>SUPERSEDING CAUSE      When an injury is caused by unrelated acts occurring at different times,   you must consider whether the last act alone would have caused the injury. If   so, the person committing the first act is not at fault, unless the last act could   have reasonably been foreseen by the person responsible for the first act.      Notes on Use      The Committee believes that the applicable instructions in Chapter 105 are normally sufficient and   that the above instruction should seldom be given.      Comment      In Steele v. Rapp, 183 Kan. 371, 383, 327 P.2d 1053 (1958), cited with approval in Barkley v.   Freeman, 16 Kan. App. 2d 575, 581, 827 P.2d 774 (1992), the court held that if “two distinct successive   causes, unrelated in their operation, conjoin to produce a given injury, the question of remote and proximate   cause becomes one of law for the decision of the court, and not a question of fact for determination by a   jury.” If the trial court does not exclude the subsequent occurrence as a matter of law, then it is rarely useful   for a jury, in a negligence case, to decide whether the act is a “concurrent” or “superseding” cause. Rather,   the applicable instructions in Chapter 105 should be adequate.     In Tinkler v. U.S. by FA.A., 982 F.2d 1456, 1467 (10th Cir. 1992), PIK 2d 5.03 [PIK 4" ] is   cited as the proper standard in Kansas for determining when an intervening cause is a superseding cause.   The court found that an air traffic control specialist negligently failed to provide weather information to   a pilot whose plane subsequently crashed. The pilot was also found to be negligent for continuing his   flight without the weather information. The court held that the pilot’s negligence was an intervening and   superseding cause of the crash, since the negligent acts of the pilot were not foreseen by or reasonably   foreseeable to the air traffic control specialist.     In Reynolds v. Kansas Dept. of Transportation, 273 Kan. 261, 9, 43 P.3d 799 (2002), the court   acknowledged that intervening and superseding causes are still recognized in extraordinary cases.      2010                 "      <h4><a name='105.01' href='105.01'>105.01</a></h4><p>COMPARATIVE FAULT THEORY AND EFFECT      You must decide this case by comparing the fault of the parties. In doing   so, you will need to know the meaning of the terms “negligence” and “fault.”      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to do   something that a reasonable person would do, or it is doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      [When you decide whether a child is negligent, you must consider the   child’s age, intelligence, abilities and experiences.|      A party is at fault when he or she is negligent and that negligence caused   or contributed to the event which brought about the claim(s) for damages.      I am required to reduce the amount of damages you may find for any   party by the percentage of fault, if any, that you find is attributable to the      party.   A party will be able to recover damages only if that party’s fault is less      than 50 percent of the total fault assigned. A party will not be able to recover   damages, however, if that party’s fault is 50 percent or more.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be used in every comparative fault case. In cases involving the comparative   negligence of child drivers, the bracketed language should not be used. See Section 19 of the Comment   below. In a medical negligence case in which expert testimony establishes the standard of care for all   parties, the applicable standard of care instruction from PIK 4" Civil, Chapter 123 should be substituted for   the definition of negligence in this instruction. See Biglow v. Eidenberg, 308 Kan. 873, 886, 424 P.3d 515   (2018).      Comment      In Reynolds v. Kansas Dept. of Transportation, 273 Kan. 261, 269, 43 P.3d 799 (2002), the court   approved this instruction’s definition of “fault.” This definition of fault and negligence was reaffirmed   in Haley v. Brown, 36 Kan. App. 2d 432, 140 P.3d 1051 (2006). The case also contains a brief, cogent   explanation of the fundamental nature of comparative fault jurisprudence in Kansas.      In Burnette v. Eubanks, 308 Kan. 838, 2, 425 P.3d 343 (2018), the court held the language   “caused or contributed to” in the instruction correctly permits a jury to find a defendant at fault only if the   defendant’s negligence had a share in producing the injury.     The concept of comparative fault as applied to all causes of action based on negligence was adopted   by the legislature by the enactment of K.S.A. 60-258a in 1974. K.S.A. 60-258b provides that the act does   not apply to any cause of action that accrued prior to July 1, 1974. The statute is entitled comparative   negligence. Since its enactment, the concept has been extended to include comparative fault in non-   negligence cases by judicial decision.      2020      "      2020      In Nail v. Doctor s Bldg., Inc., 238 Kan. 65, 708 P.2d 186 (1985), the Supreme Court approved PIK   2d 20.01 [antecedent of PIK 4" ].      In Zak v. Riffel, 34 Kan. App. 2d 93, 115 P.3d 165 (2005), the defendant physician sought to have the   plaintiff’s condition that caused the plaintiff to be under the physician’s care to be considered as an element   of fault on the part of the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals, citing PIK 3d  [now PIK 4" ], stated   that a patient’s prior condition that caused or required him to be in the care of the defendant physician   cannot be a basis for comparative fault in the negligence claim against the physician.     The Kansas appellate courts have by judicial decision adopted certain basic principles to be applied   in comparative fault cases. The principles are as follows:      1. 49 Percent Rule—Equal Fault Bars Recover      The Kansas comparative fault system is based on the “less than” or the “49 percent   tule.” The injured party may recover only where his fault was less than the fault of the   party or parties against whom claim for recovery was made. If the plaintiff and defendant   are equally at fault, there can be no recovery. These principles are discussed in Negley v.   Massey Ferguson, Inc., 229 Kan. 465, 625 P.2d 472 (1981).      2. Applicability to Non-Negligence Cases      The comparative negligence statute has been held to apply to claims based on   liability theories other than common-law negligence. For example, in Kennedy v. City   of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 450, 618 P.2d 788 (1980), the comparative negligence statute   was held applicable to claims based on strict liability or on breach of implied warranty in   products liability cases. In Wilson v. Probst, 224 Kan. 459, 581 P.2d 380 (1978), it was   held that the state’s breach of its statutory duty to repair highways had to be considered   in determining the comparative fault of the defendant’s driver and the Department of   Transportation in a claim for damages arising out of an automobile accident. See also   Thomas v. Board of Trustees of Salem Township, 224 Kan. 539, 582 P.2d 271 (1978).   Likewise, in Arredondo v. Duckwall Stores, Inc., 227 Kan. 842, 610 P.2d 1107 (1980),   comparative fault was held properly applied in an action by a negligent minor to recover   from a defendant who sold explosives to the minor in contravention of a statutory   prohibition. In Sandifer Motors, Inc. v. City of Roeland Park, 6 Kan. App. 2d 308, 628   P.2d 239 (1981), it is stated that in any situation where contributory negligence would   have been a defense, comparative negligence now applies. There, comparative fault   principles were applied where a nuisance had its origin in negligence.     If contributory negligence or an analogous defense would not have been a defense   to a claim prior to the adoption of the comparative negligence statute, K.S.A. 60-258a,   it does not apply following its adoption. Thus the statute is not applicable to suits based   solely on contracts. Federal Savings & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Huff; 237 Kan. 873, 704 P.2d   372 (1985).     Where a breach of express or implied warranty causes death, personal injury or   physical damage to property, the comparative fault statute applies. It was originally held   that if the result is simple economic loss, liability and damages are governed by breach   of contract principles. Broce-O Dell Concrete Products, Inc. v. Mel Jarvis Constr. Co.,   6 Kan. App. 2d 757, Syl. 2, 634 P.2d 1142 (1981); Haysville U.S.D. No. 261 v. GAF   Corp., 233 Kan. 635, 643, 666 P.2d 192 (1983); see also Circle Land and Cattle Corp. v.   Amoco Oil Co., 232 Kan. 482, 487, 657 P.2d 532 (1983) (upholding jury determination                            "      of comparative fault in a breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose   involving property damage). This rule was changed effective July 1, 1987, when K.S.A.   60-258a was amended to include recovery based upon economic loss.     Intentional acts of a third party may not be compared with negligent acts of a   defendant whose duty it is to protect the plaintiff from the intentional acts committed   by the third party. Kansas State Bank & Tr. Co. v. Specialized Transportation Services,   Inc., 249 Kan. 348, 819 P.2d 587 (1991); Gould v. Taco Bell, 239 Kan. 564, 722 P.2d 511   (1986).     An implied contract of indemnity may arise when one personally without fault is   made to pay for the tortious acts of another. In such cases, the concept of comparative   fault does not apply. To recover damages, the principal must be without fault. Med James,   Inc. v. Barnes, 31 Kan. App. 2d 89, 100, 61 P.3d 86 (2003).      3. Special Verdicts with No General Verdict      The comparative fault statute declares categorically that no general verdict shall   be returned by the jury. The jury is directed to return special verdicts determining the   percentage of negligence attributable to each of the parties and determining the total   amount of damages sustained by each of the claimants. After the special verdicts are   received, the trial court will apply the statutory formula and enter judgment as required   under the law. In Scales v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., 2 Kan. App. 2d 491, 500, 582   P.2d 300 (1978), an instruction advising the jury that the plaintiff’s award of damages   would be reduced by the ratio which his percentage of negligence bore to the total amount   of negligence allocated among the plaintiff and defendants was approved. In Thomas   v. Board of Trustees of Salem Township, 224 Kan. 539, 547, 582 P.2d 271 (1978), the   court approved the use of this instruction. The last two paragraphs were challenged as   prejudicial in that they informed the jury of the results of their verdict. The court found it   preferable to let the judge explain the result rather than to allow the jury to speculate and   possibly render a verdict on an erroneous speculation. If, however, the jury conspired to   circumvent the law by increasing the amount of actual damages to a fictitious figure so as   to give a negligent plaintiff his entire damages plus attorney fees, the verdict will be set   aside. Verren v. City of Pittsburg, 227 Kan. 259, 607 P.2d 36 (1980). Likewise, a quotient   verdict used in determining comparative fault will be set aside. Johnson v. Haupt, 5 Kan.   App. 2d 682, 623 P.2d 537 (1981). In a comparative negligence case tried before the   decision date of Thomas v. Board of Trustees of Salem Township, 224 Kan. 539, 582 P.2d   271 (1978), it was held not to be reversible error for the trial court to refuse to advise the   jury of the legal consequences of its answers to special questions allocating fault. Cook   v. Doty, 4 Kan. App. 2d 499, 608 P.2d 1028 (1980). In Nail v. Doctor's Bldg., Inc., 238   Kan. 65, 708 P.2d 186 (1985), the Supreme Court held that it was error for the trial court   to fail to give the concluding paragraph of PIK 2d 20.01 [PIK 4" ] because the   jury should be advised that equal or a greater percentage of fault bars a plaintiff from   recovery.      4. Parties—Actual and Phantom      Subsection (d) of K.S.A. 60-258a provides that, on motion of any party against   whom a claim is asserted for negligence, any other person whose causal negligence is   claimed to have contributed to the injury shall be joined as an additional party to the      2020      "      2020      action. The statute does not state what happens if a claim for relief is not asserted by   anyone against this new party. Formal joinder of some third person is not a prerequisite   to consideration of that person’s comparative fault. Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan.   439, 460, 618 P.2d 788 (1980); Brown v. Keill, 224 Kan. 195, 206, 580 P.2d 867 (1978).     Consideration of fault attributable to any third person claimed to be causally   negligent is essential to the determination of the parties’ liability, even though that third   person cannot be joined formally as a litigant or may be immune or judgment proof.   Brown v. Keill, 224 Kan. 195, 206, 580 P.2d 867 (1978); Miles v. West, 224 Kan. 284,   287, 580 P.2d 876 (1978); Scales v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., 2 Kan. App. 2d 491,   498, 582 P.2d 300 (1978).      In Fitzpatrick v. Allen, 24 Kan. App. 2d 896, 955 P.2d 141 (1998), the court held   that the concept of parental immunity does not mean there is no duty, only that there is   a prohibition against the recovery of damages if the duty is breached. Even if parental   immunity shields a parent from liability for negligence, the jury may still consider the   parent’s fault under K.S.A. 60-258a.     As noted in Brown, Kansas adheres to the “phantom party” concept, requiring   consideration of the proportionate responsibility of any third party claimed to be causally   negligent even though that party “cannot be formally joined as a litigant or held legally   responsible for his or her proportionate fault.” See Baird v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 535   F. Supp. 1371, 1378 (D. Kan. 1982); Haysville U.S.D. No. 261 v. GAF Corp., 233 Kan.   635, 666 P.2d 192 (1983).     When defendant joins additional parties under K.S.A. 60-258a(c), who defendant   claims contributed to plaintiff’s injuries, defendant has the burden of proving the joined   parties’ fault by a preponderance of the evidence. McGraw v. Sanders Co. Plumbing &   Heating, Inc., 233 Kan. 766, 667 P.2d 289 (1983) (holding plaintiff entitled to instruction   regarding defendant’s burden of proof concerning additional parties). See also Wooderson   v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 235 Kan. 387, 412, 681 P.2d 1038 cert. denied [Ortho   Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Wooderson] 469 U.S. 965, 105 S. Ct. 365, 83 L. Ed. 2d 301   (1984) (where there is no evidence of negligence on the part of a person, the question of   that person’s negligence need not be submitted to a jury).     The trial judge’s decision to substitute the name of an individual nurse who was   alleged to have acted negligently for the name of the named defendant hospital was held   to be error, though it was harmless in that particular case, in Haley v. Brown, 36 Kan.   App. 2d 432, 140 P.3d 1051 (2006). The court stated, “The plaintiff can choose the   parties she wishes to sue, and the defendants can bring in others if they are considered to   be at fault. The court has no authority to pick the parties.” Haley, at 437.      5. Joint and Several Liability Abolished      Subsection (d) of K.S.A. 60-258a provides that where the comparative negligence   of the parties is an issue and recovery is allowed against more than one party, each   party shall be liable for that portion of a claimant’s total damages in proportion to his   percentage of causal negligence. This provision abolishes joint and several liability   of multiple defendants in any comparative negligence case since the liability of each   defendant must be compared and is limited to his portion of the total causal negligence   attributed to all parties against whom recovery is allowed. Wood v. Groh, 269 Kan. 420,   7 P.3d 1163 (2000). See also Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788   (1980); Miles v. West, 224 Kan. 284, 580 P.2d 876 (1978).                 "      The comparative fault statute has done nothing to change the common-law   rule of joint and several liability for defendants in actions involving intentional torts.   Sieben v. Sieben, 231 Kan. 372, 0, 646 P.2d 1036 (1982). Although enactment of   comparative fault abolished joint and several liability, it was not error to instruct the jury   the city had a nondelegable duty to keep its streets in reasonably safe condition. Schmeck   v. City of Shawnee, 232 Kan. 11, 31-32, 651 P.2d 585 (1982). See also Yount v. Deibert,   282 Kan. 619, 147 P.3d 1065 (2006).      6. Failure of Party to Assert Claim as Res Judicata—The One Action Rule      In Eurich v. Alkire, 224 Kan. 236, 579 P.2d 1207 (1978), it was held that any named   party who has been properly served with a summons and who fails to assert a claim   against any party in a comparative negligence action is forever barred and may not assert   the claim in a separate lawsuit. The court stated that it was the intent of the legislature for   the parties to litigate all causes of action for negligence arising out of any occurrence in   one action. Thus any claim for damages arising out of the collision or occurrence must be   presented at the time the negligence is originally determined if the claimant is an actual   party in the case. The court recognized, however, that a person who had not been made an   actual party in a comparative negligence case is not bound by the judgment, even though   his causal negligence may have been determined.     In an action brought before the Supreme Court on a certified question, it was held   that in a damage suit the doctrine of comparative fault requires all of the parties to the   occurrence to have their fault determined in one action. Albertson v. Volkswagenwerk   Aktiengesellschaft, 230 Kan. 368, 634 P.2d 1127 (1981).     In Mathis v. TG & Y, 242 Kan. 789, 751 P.2d 136 (1988), the Supreme Court   modified the rule of Eurich v. Alkire, 224 Kan. 236, 579 P.2d 1207 (1978), by holding   that it was never the intent of the legislature to preclude a plaintiff from proceeding   against a tortfeasor when there has been no judicial determination of comparative fault.   In Anderson v. Scheffler, 242 Kan. 857, 752 P.2d 667 (1988), the Supreme Court held that   where a plaintiff is prevented from joining a necessary party in federal court because of   loss of diversity, the action against that party survives in state courts as an exception to   the Albertson rule.     In Mick v. Mani, 244 Kan. 81, 766 P.2d 147 (1988), the Supreme Court discusses in   depth the “one-action” rule in comparative negligence cases and the exceptions thereto.   Simply stated, the court concludes that a plaintiff may pursue separate actions against   tortfeasors where there has been no judicial determination of comparative fault.     In Dodge City Implement, Inc. v. Board of Barber County Comm rs, 288 Kan. 619,   205 P.3d 1265 (2009), the Supreme Court stated that Kansas law requires defendants   seeking to minimize their liability in comparative fault situations not involving a chain   of distribution or similar commercial relationship to do so by comparing the fault of other   defendants in order to reduce their own share of liability and damages. If a defendant   chooses to settle and obtain release of common liabilities involving other parties whom   the plaintiff did not sue, the defendant does not have an action for comparative implied   indemnity or postsettlement contribution. Under Kansas comparative fault procedure,   such a remedy is not necessary, and such an action defeats the policy of judicial economy,   multiplying the proceedings from a single accident or injury.     For additional cases discussing the “one action” rule, see Cook v. Freeman, 16   Kan. App. 2d 555, 825 P.2d 1185 (1992); Tersiner v. Gretencord, 17 Kan. App. 2d 551,   840 P.2d 544 (1992); and Chavez v. Markham, 256 Kan. 859, 889 P.2d 122 (1995).      2020      "      2010      7. Active-Passive Negligence Distinction Abolished      In Syllabus 5 of Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788 (1980),   the rule is stated that the statutory adoption of comparative negligence in Kansas has the   effect of abrogating the concept of indemnification based on the dichotomy of active-   passive negligence as conceptualized in Russell v. Community Hospital Association,   Inc., 199 Kan. 251, 428 P.2d 783 (1967). In Syllabus 6 of Kennedy, it is stated that   in actions where comparative negligence is in issue, the court deals in percentages of   causal responsibility, and distinctions between primary, secondary, active and passive   negligence lose their previous identities. The nature of misconduct in such cases is to be   expressed on the basis of comparative fault.      8. No Contribution Between Joint Tortfeasors      In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has held that under K.S.A. 60-258a, joint   and several liability between joint tortfeasors is no longer applicable. The individual   liability of each defendant for the payment of damages is to be based on proportionate   fault, and contribution among joint judgment debtors is no longer required in such cases   because separate individual judgments are to be rendered. Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228   Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788 (1980); Wilson v. Probst, 224 Kan. 459, 581 P.2d 380 (1978);   Brown v. Keill, 224 Kan. 195, 580 P.2d 867 (1978).      9. Effect of Release of One Tortfeasor on Other Tortfeasors      In Mulroy v. Olberding, 29 Kan. App. 2d 757, 30 P.3d 1050 (2001) rev. denied 273   Kan. 1036 (2002), the court noted that Kansas has adopted the “specific identity rule”   for actions brought under K.S.A. 60-258a. In comparative negligence actions, releases   utilizing general language no longer extinguish the potential liability of codefendants   unless they are specifically named or identified or described by the terms of the release.   See also Luther v. Danner, 268 Kan. 343, 995 P.2d 865 (2000); Geier v. Wikel, 4 Kan.   App. 2d 188, 603 P.2d 1028 (1979).      10. Implied Comparative Indemnity Between Tortfeasors      In Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788 (1980), the Supreme   Court adopted the concept of comparative implied indemnity between joint tortfeasors.   Where a settlement for plaintiff’s entire injuries or damages has been made by one   tortfeasor during the pendency of a comparative negligence action and a release of all   liability has been given by plaintiff to all who may have contributed to the damages,   an apportionment of responsibility can then be pursued in the action by the tortfeasor   who has settled claimant’s claim. In such an action for apportionment of responsibility,   the settling tortfeasor is required to establish the reasonableness of the amount of the   settlement and that there was a reasonable basis for his legal liability for the injuries and   damages. The advantage of this rule is that one of the joint tortfeasors may pay off the   plaintiff in full and thus fully satisfy the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant joint tortfeasors   may then litigate the apportionment of responsibility among themselves.     A defendant, who settled with plaintiff, may not proceed against a co-defendant   in a suit for comparative implied indemnity where the co-defendant was not subject to                            "      actual liability, because plaintiff made no claim against the defendants and the statute   of limitations for any claim by plaintiff had passed. Ellis v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 231   Kan. 182, 2, 643 P.2d 158 (1982). See also Teepak, Inc. v. Learned, 237 Kan. 320,   699 P.2d 35 (1985).     In Dodge City Implement, Inc. v. Board of Barber County Comm rs, 288 Kan. 619,   205 P.3d 1265 (2009), the Supreme Court stated that Kansas law requires defendants   seeking to minimize their liability in comparative fault situations not involving a chain   of distribution or similar commercial relationship to do so by comparing the fault of other   defendants in order to reduce their own share of liability and damages. If a defendant   chooses to settle and obtain release of common liabilities involving other parties whom   the plaintiff did not sue, the defendant does not have an action for comparative implied   indemnity or postsettlement contribution. Under Kansas comparative fault procedure,   such a remedy is not necessary, and such an action defeats the policy of judicial economy,   multiplying the proceedings from a single accident or injury.      11. Workers Compensation Subrogation Rights of Negligent Employer      In Negley v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 229 Kan. 465, 625 P.2d 472 (1981), two   workmen were electrocuted on the job when a forklift came in contact with an overhead   power line owned and maintained by the Kansas Power and Light Company. The widows   of these workmen were awarded workers compensation benefits. The two widows   brought wrongful death actions against the manufacturer of the forklift and against KP   & L. The jury returned verdicts finding that one of the decedent employees was 22%   negligent, Orlan, Inc., the employer was 68% negligent, and KP & L was 10% negligent.   Orlan, Inc. claimed subrogation rights under the provisions of the Workers Compensation   Act, K.S.A. 44-504(b). The court reasoned that the extent and nature of the subrogation   rights of an employer under the workers compensation statute are matters for legislative   determination. K.S.A. 44-504 provides for full subrogation and provides no reduction in   the amount of the subrogation regardless of the percentage of contributory negligence   attributable to the employer. The court recognized the inequities in the result but felt   obligated to enforce the clear provisions of the statute. It held any changes in this rule   would have to be accomplished by the state legislature.      The inequities created by the conflict between the Workers Compensation Act   and comparative fault were corrected by the enactment of K.S.A. 44-504(d) in 1982.   The employer’s subrogation interest is diminished by the percentage of damage award   attributed to the negligence of the employer or those for whom the employer is responsible,   other than the injured worker. McGraw v. Sanders Co. Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 233   Kan. 766, 768, 667 P.2d 289 (1983) (holding the trial court properly denied admission of   workers compensation lien).      12. Assumption of Risk      “[O]ur review of the caselaw now convinces us the doctrine’s retention in Kansas   runs counter to the approach taken in the vast majority of comparative fault jurisdictions,   which eliminated assumption of risk after comparative fault was adopted. .. . We hold the   comparative fault statute should control, and now overrule our prior caselaw adhering to   the assumption of risk doctrine as an absolute bar to recovery.” Simmons v. Porter, 298   Kan. 299, 300, 312 P.3d 345 (2013).      2016      "      2020      13. Nonapplicability to Bailment Cases      Comparative fault does not change the law of bailment. In an action by a bailor   against a bailee for loss of property occasioned by theft, the fault of the thief should not   be compared with the negligence of the bailee. M. Bruenger & Co., Inc. v. Dodge City   Truck Stop, Inc., 234 Kan. 682, 684, 675 P.2d 864 (1984).      14. The Rescue Doctrine      In Bridges v. Bentley, 244 Kan. 434, 769 P.2d 635 (1989), it was held that the rescue   doctrine in negligence cases has not been abrogated by the enactment of the comparative   negligence statute.      15. Intentional Acts of a Third Party      Intentional acts of a third party may not be compared with negligent acts of a   defendant whose duty it is to protect the plaintiff from the intentional acts committed   by the third party. Kansas State Bank & Tr. Co. v. Specialized Transportation Services,   Inc., 249 Kan. 348, 819 P.2d 587 (1991); Gould v. Taco Bell, 239 Kan. 564, 722 P.2d 511   (1986).      16. The Relation Between Comparative Fault and Mitigation of Damages      In Cox v. Lesko, 263 Kan. 805, 953 P.2d 1033 (1998), the Supreme Court held   that a patient’s fault in failing to undergo physical therapy could be compared with the   negligence of the physician in performing the surgery rather than being considered under   a mitigation of damages concept.      17. The Relation Between Comparative Fault and the Maximum Permissible Recovery for   Nonpecuniary Damages in an Action for Wrongful Death Under K.S.A. 60-1903.      In Gann v. Joeckel, 20 Kan. App. 2d 136, 141, 884 P.2d 451 (1994), the court held   that in applying the comparative negligence statute, K.S.A. 60-258a, in an action for   wrongful death due to an automobile accident brought under K.S.A. 60-1901 et seq., the   percentages of causal fault attributable to any direct negligence of the decedent or the   plaintiff are to be used to reduce the amount of damages awarded by the court or jury   for nonpecuniary damages, rather than to reduce the maximum permissible recovery for   nonpecuniary damages allowable under K.S.A. 60-1903.     The decision follows the reasoning in McCart v. Muir, 230 Kan. 618, 629, 641   P.2d 384 (1982), and Bright v. Cargill, Inc., 251 Kan. 387, 415, 837 P.2d 348 (1992).   The decision in Gann was approved in Dickey v. Daughety, 260 Kan. 12, 917 P.2d 889   (1996).     Where the jury award for nonpecuniary damages attributable to the defendant   exceeds the cap, the court shall enter a judgment against the defendant for nonpecuniary   damages in an amount equal to the maximum allowable under the cap. A settlement   with a defendant who might be held liable for a proportional share of the damages for                             "      wrongful death has no effect on the plaintiff’s right to recover judgment. Adams v. Via   Christi Regional Medical Center, 270 Kan. 824, 19 P.3d 132 (2001).      18. Subsequent Remedial Conduct      DiPietro v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 28 Kan. App. 2d 372, 16 P.3d 986 (2000), held   evidence of subsequent remedial conduct cannot be introduced by the plaintiff to rebut   the defendant’s evidence of the plaintiff’s comparative fault.      19. Comparative Fault of a Child      The common-law rule imposing arbitrary age classifications has been abrogated   in Kansas. “A child is required to exercise that degree of care and caution ordinarily   exercised by children of like age, intelligence, capacity, and experience under the   circumstances then existing.” Honeycutt v. City of Wichita, 247 Kan. 250, Syl. J 3, 796   P.2d 549 (1990). The Honeycutt court further stated that ordinarily the negligence of a   child should be determined by the factfinder. But see Williams v. Esaw, 214 Kan. 658,   522 P.2d 950 (1974), which holds that a minor driving an automobile is held to the same   standard as an adult. Under such circumstances, neither the bracketed language regarding   a child nor PIK 4"  should be given.      20. Proximate Cause      In Hale v. Brown, 287 Kan. 320, 197 P.3d 438 (2008), the Supreme Court ruled   that comparative fault, as adopted in Kansas, did not do away with the requirement that   proximate cause exist between the act complained of and the damages sought.      21. Medical Malpractice Cases      In Maunz v. Perales, 276 Kan. 313, 76 P.3d 1027 (2003), comparative negligence   principles were applied to medical malpractice cases. The court stated that if a mentally   disturbed patient is capable of exercising care for himself, that patient must act reasonably   considering the reduced capacity exercised. The court affirmed the long standing rule that   in medical malpractice settings, juries may consider proof of the patient’s fault where   health care providers have not fully assumed the patient’s duty of self care.     In Puckett v. Mt. Carmel Regional Med. Center, 290 Kan. 406, 228 P.3d 1048   (2010), a medical malpractice case, the Supreme Court stated that a negligent health care   provider cannot be held solely liable for subsequent negligence of other treating health   care providers. If successive negligent actions of more than one health care provider   combined to cause an injury, the liability of each care provider must be allocated based   on comparative fault.      2010      "       <h4><a name='105.02' href='105.02'>105.02</a></h4><p>COMPARATIVE FAULT THEORY AND EFFECT—CHILDREN      Comment      This instruction has been deleted.

That person’s percentage of fault must be taken into   consideration in determining the total fault even though he is not joined as a party. All those causally   negligent must be considered. Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 460, 618 P.2d 788 (1980); Brown   v. Keill, 224 Kan. 195, 206, 580 P.2d 86 (1978).     Where the evidence warrants it, the court must add that person as a party solely for the purpose   of determining and allocating fault upon a one hundred percent basis. This is done by giving the above   instruction and including these persons in the special verdict form.     This situation may exist where a contributing tortfeasor was given a release with reservations, a   covenant not to sue, or may be unavailable as a party for lack of jurisdiction or unidentifiability, such as   a phantom driver. A settling tortfeasor or absent tortfeasor is a party only for the purpose of allocation of   percentage of fault. Geier v. Wikel, 4 Kan. App. 2d 188, 603 P.2d 1028 (1979).     The Kansas Supreme Court in Gaulden v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 232 Kan. 205, , 654 P.2d   383 (1982), reversed the trial court for failing to submit a settling tortfeasor’s negligence to the jury.     The Kansas Court of Appeals rejected the defendant’s argument that only defendants may request   nonparty comparative fault instructions, holding that a trial court should allow the jury to apportion fault   among all potential tortfeasors where the evidence so requires, regardless of which party requests the   instructions. Here, the trial court committed reversible error in denying the plaintiff’s request to compare   the negligence of nonparty doctors. Dickerson v. St. Luke's South Hospital, Inc., 51 Kan.

The (principal) (employer) is the person for whom the services are   to be performed. Their agreement may be written, oral, or implied by the   behavior of the parties. Compensation for the services is not required.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given only when there is an issue as to the existence of an agency.      Comment      Agency refers to a fiduciary relationship by which a party, the “principal,” confides to another, the   “agent,” the management of some business to be transacted by the agent on behalf of the principal. The   fundamental concept of agency is that the principal delegates to the agent the authority to act on behalf of   the principal in performing an act, in a lawful manner, that the principal could have lawfully performed.   Therefore the act of the agent becomes the act of the principal. An element of the relationship is that the   principal exercises some degree of control over the conduct and activities of the agent.     An agency relationship has been defined as a contract, either express or implied, by which one of   the parties confides to the other the management of some business to be transacted in his name, or on his   account, and by which that other assumes to do the business and to render an account of it. Professional   Lens Plan, Inc. v. Polaris Leasing Corp., 238 Kan. 384, 710 P.2d 1297 (1985).     The issues to be considered in determining whether an agency relationship exists are summarized in   Brown v. Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975), where the court held:     “The law recognizes two distinct types of agencies-one actual, and the other   ostensible or apparent. What constitutes agency and whether there is any competent   evidence reasonably tending to prove such a relationship is a question of law. (Greep v.   Bruns, 160 Kan. 48, 159 P.2d 803 [1945]; Shugar v. Antrim, 177 Kan. 70, 276 P.2d 372   [1954]; Hendrix v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 203 Kan. 140, 453 P.2d 486 [1969].)     “To determine whether the record establishes an agency by agreement it must   be examined to ascertain if the party sought to be charged as principal has delegated   authority to the alleged agent by words which expressly authorize the agent to do the   delegated act. If there is evidence of that character, the authority of the agent is express.   If no express authorization is found, then the evidence must be considered to determine   whether the alleged agent possesses implied powers. The test utilized by this court to   determine if the alleged agent possesses implied powers is whether, from the facts and   circumstances of the particular case, it appears there was an implied intention to create an   agency; in which event, the relation may be held to exist, notwithstanding either a denial   by the alleged principal, or whether the parties understood it to be an agency. (Rodgers   v. Arapahoe Pipe Line Co., 185 Kan. 424, 345 P.2d 702 [1959].) In C.J.S., Agency page   626 § 52, it is stated:     ‘An implied agency must be based on facts for which the principal is   responsible. These facts must, in the absence of estoppel, be such as to imply      2010      "      2008      an intention to create the agency, and the implication must arise from a natural   and reasonable, and not from a forced, strained, or distorted, construction of   them. They must lead to the reasonable conclusion that mutual assent exists,   and be such as naturally lead another to believe in and to rely on the agency.   The existence of the relation will not be assumed.     “While the relation may be implied from a single transaction, it is   more readily inferable from a series of transactions.     ‘On the question of implied agency, it is the manifestation of the   alleged principal and agent as between themselves that is decisive, and not   the appearance to a third party or what the third party should have known. An   agency will not be inferred because a third person assumed that it existed, or   because the alleged agent assumed to act as such, or because the conditions   and circumstances were such as to make such an agency seem natural and   probable and to the advantage of the supposed principal, or from facts which   show that the alleged agent was a mere instrumentality.      ‘The existence of a valid express contract for services as an agent   precludes the implication of a contract covering the same subject-matter, and   resort to an express provision in a contract relative to agency precludes any   determination that there was an implied agency.’     “The doctrine of apparent or ostensible authority is predicated upon the theory of   estoppel. An ostensible or apparent agent is one whom the principal has intentionally   or by want of ordinary care induced and permitted third persons to believe to be his   agent even though no authority, either express or implied, has been conferred upon him.   (Greep v. Bruns, supra; Theis v. duPont, Glore Forgan, Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 510 P.2d 1212   [1973].)     “Ratification is the adoption or confirmation by a principal of an act performed   on his behalf by an agent which act was performed without authority. The doctrine of   ratification is based upon the assumption there has been no prior authority, and ratification   by the principal of the agent’s unauthorized act is equivalent to an original grant of   authority. Upon acquiring knowledge of his agent’s unauthorized act, the principal should   promptly repudiate the act; otherwise it will be presumed he has ratified and affirmed the   act. (Theis v. duPont, Glore Forgan Inc., supra, and cases cited therein.) Knowledge of   the unauthorized act is essential for the principal to ratify the act, and must be shown or   facts proved that its existence is a necessary inference therefrom.     “The liability of a principal for the negligent acts of his agent is determined by   whether the agent was engaged in the furtherance of the principal’s business to such a   degree that the principal had the right to direct and control the activities of the agent.   (Hughes v. Jones, 206 Kan. 82, 476 P.2d 588 [1970].) Liability of the principal is grounded   upon the doctrine of respondeat superior. (Jacobson v. Parrill, 186 Kan. 467, 351 P.2d   194 [1960].) The primary factor to be considered is the control which the principal has   over the agent.” Brown, 217 Kan. at 8.     See also Highland Lumber Co., Inc. v. Knudson, 219 Kan. 366, 548 P.2d 719 (1976).     In Foley Co. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 28 Kan. App. 2d 219, 15 P.3d 353 (2000), the court held that   “[u]nder agency law, once a principal knows of an agent’s unauthorized actions, it cannot sit back and see if   it will benefit or suffer from the agent’s actions. Instead, a principal who receives notice of an unauthorized   act of an agent must promptly repudiate the agent’s actions or it is presumed that the principal ratified the   act. Ratification is the adoption or confirmation by a principal of an unauthorized act performed on its   behalf by an agent. Theis v. duPont, Glore Forgan Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 510 P.2d 1212 (1973).”                 "      Generally, a principal’s ratification of an unauthorized act is ratification of the whole act. However,   where a plaintiff ratified his attorney’s unauthorized settlement of a claim, the ratification did not extend to   the attorney’s separate wrongful act of forging plaintiff’s endorsement on a settlement draft. King v. White,   265 Kan. 627, 962 P.2d 475 (1998).     “The test in determining the existence of agency, so that the liability for a servant’s negligence will   be imputed to the master, is the right to control the purported servant. Whether there is any competent   evidence to prove the existence of agency is a question of law.” Major v. Castlegate, Inc., 23 Kan. App. 2d   694, Syl. 1, 935 P.2d 225, rev. denied 262 Kan. 962 (1997).     The determination of what constitutes agency and whether there is any competent evidence   reasonably tending to prove the existence of agency is a question of law. Professional Lens Plan, Inc.   v. Polaris Leasing Corp., 238 Kan. 384, 710 P.2d 1297 (1985); Henderson v. Hassur, 225 Kan. 678, 594   P.2d 650 (1979); Highland Lumber Co., Inc. v. Knudson, 219 Kan. 366, 2, 548 P.2d 719 (1976); Dowling   v. Southwestern Porcelain, Inc., 237 Kan. 536, 701 P.2d 954 (1985); Brown v.

Kansas Gas Supply Corp., 250 Kan. 438, 827 P.2d 24 (1992), the court   held “[w]hat constitutes agency and whether there is competent evidence reasonably tending to prove   the relationship is a question of law. Although what constitutes agency is a question of law, resolution   of conflicting evidence which might establish its existence is for the finder of fact. Aetna Casualty and   Surety Co. v. Hepler State Bank, 6 Kan. App. 2d 543, 548, 630 P.2d 721 (1981). The weight to be given   evidence and resolution of conflicts therein are functions of the trier of facts in the determination of whether   there is a relationship of principal and agent. Where the existence of agency is disputed, its existence or   nonexistence is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, to be determined upon proper instructions. CIT   Financial Services, Inc. v. Gott, 5 Kan. App. 2d 224, , 615 P.2d 774, rev. denied 228 Kan. 806   (1980).” Barbara Oil Co., 250 Kan. at .      Actual Agency     The law recognizes two distinct types of agencies, one actual and the other ostensible or apparent.   The authority of an actual agent may be either express or implied. Brown v. Wichita State University, 217   Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975); Miotk v. Rudy, 4 Kan. App. 2d 296, 605 P.2d 587, (1980); Theis v. duPont,   Glore Forgan, Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 306, 510 P.2d 1212 (1973); Dealers Leasing, Inc. v. Allen, 26 Kan. App.   2d 745, 994 P.2d 651 (1999).      It is an express agency if the principal has delegated authority to the agent by words that expressly   authorize the agent to do a delegable act. It is an implied agency if it appears from the statements and   conduct of the parties and other relevant circumstances that the intention was to clothe the agent with such   an appearance of authority that when the agency was exercised it would normally and naturally lead others   to rely on the person’s acts as being authorized by the principal. An ostensible or apparent agency may exist   if a principal has intentionally or by want of ordinary care induced and permitted third persons to believe a   person is his or her agent even though no authority, either express or implied, has been actually conferred   upon the agent. Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993); Kansas City Heartland Const. Co.   v. Maggie Jones Southport Cafe, Inc., 250 Kan. 32, 824 P.2d 926 (1992); Barbara Oil Co. v.

An agency will not be inferred because a third person assumed that it existed.... ° ” Brown v.   Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279, 287, 540 P.2d 66 (1975), quoting 2A C.J.S., Agency, § 52, p. 626.     “Implied agency is based on an implied intention to create an agency. It arises upon facts for which   the principal is responsible. It arises when, from the statements and conduct of the parties, it appears that   the principal, or the principal and the ‘agent,’ intended to make it appear to others that the acts of the ‘agent’   were authorized by the principal.” Mohr v. State Bank of Stanley, 241 Kan. 42, 46, 734 P.2d 1071 (1987).   See also Kansas City Heartland Const. Co. v. Maggie Jones Southport Cafe, Inc., 250 Kan. 32, 824 P.2d   926 (1992).      Apparent Agency      An actual agency exists by agreement, express or implied, between the principal and agent. However,   apparent or ostensible agency is based on the conduct of the principal toward a third party. Apparent agency   is often asserted in conjunction with a claim of equitable estoppel. See Kansas City Heartland Const. Co.   v. Maggie Jones Southport Cafe, Inc., 250 Kan. 32, 824 P.2d 926 (1992); Cairo Cooperative Exchange   v. First Nat'l Bank of Cunningham, 4 Kan.

Apparent agency has on occasion been referred to as agency   by estoppel on the theory that the principal, due to his or her conduct, should not be allowed to deny the   existence of an agency relation. Adair v. Transcontinental Oil Co., 184 Kan. 454, 338 P.2d 79 (1959).     “Apparent authority, or ostensible authority as it is also called, is that which, though not actually   granted, the principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise or which he holds him out as possessing.   Accordingly, an apparent agent is one who, with or without authority, reasonably appears to third persons   to be authorized to act as the agent of another.” Ford v. Guarantee Abstract & Title Co., 220 Kan. 244, 553   P.2d 254 (1976), quoting Greep v. Bruns, 160 Kan. 48, 159 P.2d 803 (1945). See also Miotk v. Rudy, 4 Kan.   App. 2d 296, 605 P.2d 587 (1980).      “Apparent [or ostensible] agency is based on intentional actions or words of the principal toward   third parties which reasonably induce or permit third parties to believe that an agency relationship exists.”   Kansas City Heartland Const. Co. v. Maggie Jones Southport Cafe, Inc., 250 Kan. 32, 41, 824 P.2d 926   (1992). See also Mohr v. State Bank of Stanley, 241 Kan. 42, 734 P.2d 1071 (1987).      An ostensible or apparent agency may exist if a principal has intentionally or by want of ordinary   care induced and permitted third persons to believe a person is his or her agent even though no authority,   either express or implied, has been actually conferred upon the agent.

Burden of Proof      Where the agency relationship is in issue the party relying thereon to establish his claim has the   burden of establishing the existence of the relationship by clear and satisfactory evidence. Highland Lumber   Co., Inc. v. Knudson, 219 Kan. 366, 548 P.2d 719 (1976); Brown v. Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279,   540 P.2d 66 (1975); Rodgers v. Arapahoe Pipe Line Co., 185 Kan. 424, 345 P.2d 702 (1959).     The burden of establishing the agency is on the party asserting it. There is no presumption that one in   possession of a vehicle is the servant, employee, or agent of the owner and acting for the owner. Ownership      alone is not sufficient to impute the negligence of the driver to the owner. Felix v. U.S.D. No. 202, 22 Kan.   App. 2d 849, 923 P.2d 1056 (1996).                 "      Other Issues      The existence of a duty is a question of law, not of fact. However, the Committee notes for reference   Schmidt v. HTG, Inc., 265 Kan. 372, 961 P.2d 677 (1998), which states:      “Generally, in the absence of a ‘special relationship,’ one has no duty to control   the conduct of a third party to prevent harm to others. A special relationship may exist,   however, with persons in charge of one with dangerous propensities or persons with   custody of another.     “One who takes charge of a third person whom he or she knows or should know   to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise   reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him or her from doing such harm.     “A parole officer does not take charge or exercise control over a parolee so as to   create a special relationship between the officer and parolee, thereby imposing a duty   upon the State to control the conduct of the parolee to prevent harm to other persons or   property...” Syl. 91 4-6.     K.S.A. 60-3701 provides that in any civil action no award of punitive or exemplary damages shall   be assessed against “a principal or employer for the acts of an agent or employee unless the questioned   conduct was authorized or ratified by a person expressly empowered to do so on behalf of the principal or   employer.” See also Hartford Accident & Ins.

An agent purporting to act on his own account, but who in fact contracts on behalf of an undeclared   principal, becomes a party to the contract and is personally liable thereon. Bruce v. Smith, 204 Kan. 473,   464 P.2d 224 (1970).

Comment      “A master or principal is responsible for the tortious acts of his servant or agent where such acts are   incidental to and done in furtherance of the business of the master or principal, even if such acts are done   willfully or in excess of the authority conferred.” Kiser v. Skelly Oil Co., 136 Kan. 812, 816, 18 P.2d 181   (1933).     An employer is liable for the tortious acts of his or her employee only under special circumstances.   Special circumstances exist when the employee is on the employer’s premises, performing work for the   employer, or using the employer’s chattel, or when the employer voluntarily assumes a duty to control   the employee, or when the employer negligently retains a known incompetent or unfit employee. Thies v.   Cooper, 243 Kan. 149, 156, 753 P.2d 1280 (1988). See also Calwell v. Hassan, 21 Kan. App. 2d 729, 908   P.2d 184 (1995); Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993).      If an agent is sued alone, he or she may be held liable. “An agent cannot escape liability to third   persons by pleading he acted at the command or on account of the principal. This is for the reason that the   tort liability of the agent is not based on the contractual relationship between the principal and agent, but   on the common-law obligation that every person must so act or use that which he controls as not to injure   another. (Am. Jur., Agency § 326; Restatement of the Law, Agency, 343, p. 753.) The contention that the   defendant would be liable only if acting outside the scope of his employment and authority is not correct.   He is liable to third parties in either event.” Russell v.

Shunga Plaza, Inc. v. American   Employers’ Ins. Co., 204 Kan. 790, 796, 465 P.2d 987 (1970).      PIK 2d 7.04 [PIK 4" ] was cited with approval in Williams v. Community Drive-In Theater,   Inc., 214 Kan. 359, 520 P.2d 1296 (1974). An employee is acting within the scope of his authority when   he is performing services for which he has been employed, or when he is doing anything that is reasonably   incidental to his employment. The test is not necessarily whether the specific conduct was expressly   authorized or forbidden by the employer, but whether such conduct should have been fairly foreseen from   the nature of the employment and the duties relating to it. See also Commerce Bank of St. Joseph v. State,   251 Kan. 207, 833 P.2d 996 (1992).      Liability of employer for acts of his employee depends not upon whether the injurious act of   employee was willful and intentional or was unintentional, but upon whether employee, when he did the   wrong, was acting in prosecution of employer’s business and within scope of his authority or had stepped      2010                   aside from that business and had done an individual wrong. Hollinger v. Stormont Hosp. & Training School   for Nurses, 2 Kan. App. 2d 302, 578 P.2d 1121 (1978).

K.S.A. 60-3701 provides that in any civil action where a claim for punitive or exemplary damages   is included no award of punitive or exemplary damages shall be assessed against “a principal or employer   for the acts of an agent or employee unless the questioned conduct was authorized or ratified by a person   expressly empowered to do so on behalf of the principal or employer.” See also Hartford Accident & Ins.

In O’Shea v. Welch, 350 F.3d 1101 (10th Cir. 2003), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals relied upon   PIK 3d  [now PIK 4" ] in predicting that Kansas courts would hold that a mere deviation by   an employee from the strict course of his employment duty does not release his employer from liability   for the employee’s actions if the employee’s main purpose is still to carry on the business of the employer.   Noting that its only guidance to Kansas law was from the jury instruction, the court determined that, while   a substantial deviation by an employee from his employer’s business would absolve the employer from   liability during that lapse, a slight or incidental deviation by the employee would not. Several factors may   be considered in determining whether the deviation is substantial or slight including:     1) the employee’s intent;     2) the nature, time and place of the deviation;     3) the time consumed in the deviation;     4) the work for which the employee was hired;     5) the incidental acts reasonably expected by the employer; and     6) the freedom allowed the employee in performing his job responsibilities.

In those cases where ratification may be implied from   the course of conduct of the principal, the court may also add the second optional paragraph. The second   optional paragraph may be given in addition to the first optional paragraph or in lieu thereof, depending   on the circumstances of the case. See Smith v.

Comment      K.S.A. 60-3701 provides that in any civil action where a claim for punitive or exemplary damages   is included, no award of punitive or exemplary damages shall be assessed against “a principal or employer   for the acts of an agent or employee unless the questioned conduct was authorized or ratified by a person   expressly empowered to do so on behalf of the principal or employer.” For a discussion of the ratification   concept as used in this statute see Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993).     In the context of agency law ratification is defined as “the adoption or confirmation by a principal of   an act performed on his behalf by an agent, which act was performed without authority.” Smith v. Printup,   254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993); Schraft v. Leis, 236 Kan. 28, 686 P.2d 865 (1984). See also Brown v.   Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975).     Generally, a principal’s ratification of an unauthorized act is ratification of the whole act. However,   where a plaintiff ratified his attorney’s unauthorized settlement of a claim, the ratification did not extend to   the attorney’s separate wrongful act of forging plaintiff’s endorsement on a settlement draft. King v. White,   265 Kan. 627, 962 P.2d 475 (1998).      In Foley Co. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 28 Kan. App. 2d 219, 15 P.3d 353 (2000), the court held that   “[u]nder agency law, once a principal knows of an agent’s unauthorized actions, it cannot sit back and see if       2010      "      2010      it will benefit or suffer from the agent’s actions. Instead, a principal who receives notice of an unauthorized   act of an agent must promptly repudiate the agent’s actions or it is presumed that the principal ratified the   act. Ratification is the adoption or confirmation by a principal of an unauthorized act performed on its   behalf by an agent. Theis v. duPont, Glore Forgan Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 510 P.2d 1212 (1973).”     Whether there has been a repudiation within a reasonable time is a question of fact. The ratification   of an unauthorized act is not the ratification of another entirely separate and distinct act. See Theis v.   duPont, Glore Forgan Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 510 P.2d 1212 (1973).     In Brown v. Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975), the court held “Knowledge   of the unauthorized act is essential for the principal to ratify the act, and must be shown or facts proved that   its existence is a necessary inference therefrom.” In a later case, the court held that an employer may ratify   an employee’s misconduct where the acts occurred with such frequency that the employer knew “or should   have known” of the questionable conduct. Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993).     In cases predating Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985 (1993), it was held that the doctrine   of ratification “is confirmation after conduct, amounting to a substitute for prior authority.” Adrian v. Elmer,   178 Kan. 242, 284 P.2d 599 (1955). In Smith, the court held that evidence of corporate policies, procedures   or managerial behavior could lead to a jury finding that the questioned conduct of the employee was   authorized or ratified. In such instances, ratification precedes the questioned conduct.

Persons are considered to be partners when they join together   to carry on as co-owners a business for profit, whether or not the persons   actually intended to form a partnership.      Factors you may consider in deciding whether persons are partners   include .      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 56a-101, K.S.A. 56a-202, George v. Capital South Mtg.

In the second paragraph the court should list those factors tending to prove the existence of a   partnership.   K.S.A. 56a-202(c) sets forth the following rules to be considered:   (1) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common   property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-   owners share profits made by the use of the property.   (2) The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the   persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the   returns are derived.   (3) A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner   in the business, unless the profits were received in payment:     (1) Ofa debt by installments or otherwise;     (ii) or services as an independent contractor or of wages or other   compensation to an employee;     (iii) of rent;     (iv) of an annuity or other retirement or health benefit to a beneficiary,   representative, or designee of a deceased or retired partner;     (v) of interest or other charge on a loan, even if the amount of payment   varies with the profits of the business, including a direct or indirect   present or future ownership of the collateral, or rights to income,   proceeds, or increase in value derived from the collateral; or     (vi) forthe sale of the goodwill ofa business or other property by installments   or otherwise.     In George, decided in 1998, the court approved the following list of factors set forth in the 1946 Potts   decision:   “Numbered among the often approved tests to which we have referred are the following:   Intention of parties to the contract; sharing in profits and losses; charging of losses   against accumulated profits; community of control over management and direction of       2010      "      2016      the business; active participation in management of the affairs of the enterprise; joint   control and exercise of ownership over all or part of the business assets; participation   in division of the net earnings; sharing in payment of expenses of operation; fixing of   salaries by joint agreement; investment in the business of undistributed profits for the   purpose of building up a substantial cash reserve; division of undistributed profits in the   event of liquidation contingent upon repayment to one of the parties of cash originally   invested in capital.”      Comment      The 1998 Kansas Legislature replaced the Uniform Partnership Act of 1972 with a revised Uniform   Partnership Act that became effective January 1, 1999. (K.S.A. 56a-101 et seq.)     Kansas courts have recognized the difficulty in defining a partnership and determining whether a   partnership exists. Wade v. Hornaday, 92 Kan. 293, 140 P. 870 (1914); Potts v. Lux, 161 Kan. 217, 166 P.2d   694 (1946). PIK 4"  incorporates the statutory definition of a partnership. (K.S.A. 56a-101, K.S.A.   56a-202). The revised Uniform Partnership Act added to the definition of partnership the phrase “whether   or not the persons intend to form a partnership.” This additional language merely codifies prevailing case   law that “a partnership is created by the association of persons whose intent is to carry on as co-owners a   business for profit, regardless of their subjective intention to be ‘partners’.” UPA § 202 cmt. 1.     A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners. (K.S.A. 56a-201). A partnership may sue or be   sued in the name of the partnership, but a judgment against the partnership is not a judgment against a   partner. A judgment against the partnership may not be satisfied from the personal assets of a partner unless   the partner is also personally liable for the claim and the claim cannot be satisfied from the partnership   assets or for other statutory reasons set forth in K.S.A. 56a-307.     A partnership formed under the revised Kansas Uniform Partnership Act, K.S.A. 56a-101 et seq.   may be converted to a limited liability partnership. K.S.A. 56a-1001.      “Whether a partnership exists between particular persons is a mixed question of law and fact. If there   is no dispute as to the facts the question is one of law for the court to determine. If the agreement under   which a business arrangement is carried on, and which is claimed to be a partnership, is in writing, and free   from ambiguity or doubt, its legal effect must be determined as a matter of law. If an attempt to establish a   partnership wholly fails through lack of evidence, the court may properly decide as a matter of law that no   partnership exists. The existence of a partnership is also a question of fact, and it is the province of the court   in absence of a jury to decide whether those facts exist which show that a partnership has been formed.   (Stalker v. DeWitt, 142 Kan. 709, 51 P.2d 1012 [1935].)” Beverly v. McCullick, 211 Kan. 87, 96-97, 505   P.2d 624 (1973).      Whether a partnership exists between particular individuals depends on the intention of the parties,   the terms of their agreement, and the manner in which their business affairs are carried out. Grimm v.   Pallesen, 215 Kan. 660, 527 P.2d 978 (1974).     A person may estop himself from denying his liability as a partner, where such relationship does   not exist in fact, by holding himself out as such, or where his course of conduct and representations leads   another to believe he is a partner, and the party misled extends credit in reliance thereon. Muse v. Baker,   216 Kan. 788, 533 P.2d 1234 (1975).     The Uniform Partnership Act recognizes the principle of delectus personae by distinguishing a   partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s right to participate in management. A partner’s interest   in the partnership is his or her share of the profits and surplus. In a limited partnership, the partner’s interest   is a share of the profits and losses and the right to receive distributions of partnership assets. Temple v.   White Lakes Plaza Assoc., Ltd., 15 Kan. App. 2d 771, 816 P.2d 399 (1991).                  "      Sharing of profits and losses is not always a conclusive test.

The other party has no right to direct or control the manner in which the   work is performed.      Comment      Independent contractor is defined in Snyder v. Lamb, 191 Kan. 446, 381 P.2d 508 (1963). It is also   noted that the right-of-control test is not an exclusive test. Other relevant facts are to be considered. See   Bush v. Wilson & Co., 157 Kan. 82, 138 P.2d 457 (1943).      An independent contractor is defined as one who, in exercising an independent employment,   contracts to do certain work according to his or her own methods, without being subject to the control of   the employer, except as to the results or product of his or her work. The primary test used by the courts   in determining whether the employer-employee relationship exists is whether the employer has the right   of control and supervision over the work of the alleged employee, and the right to direct the manner in   which the work is to be performed, as well as the result which is to be accomplished. It is not the actual   interference or exercise of the control by the employer, but the existence of the right or authority to interfere   or control, which renders one a servant rather than an independent contractor. Mitzner v. State Dept. of SRS,   257 Kan. 258, 891 P.2d 435 (1995).     Where facts are undisputed or evidence is susceptible of only a single conclusion, it is a question of   law for courts whether an individual has the status of an employee or independent contractor. Mitzner v.   State Dept. of SRS, 257 Kan. 258, 891 P.2d 435 (1995).     For facts to be considered in distinguishing employees from independent contractors, see Bush v.

An exception to the general rule of nonliability of an employer for the negligence of an independent   contractor is the inherently dangerous activity doctrine. That doctrine provides that one who employs an   independent contractor to do work involving a special danger to others which the employer knows or has   reason to know to be inherent in or normal to the work, or which the employer contemplates or has reason   to contemplate when making the contract, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to others by the   contractor’s failure to take reasonable precautions against such dangers.

The common-law defense of assumption of risk has not been altered by the adoption of comparative   fault, K.S.A. 60-258a, and continues to constitute an absolute bar to recovery in those cases where the   defense is applicable. Jackson v. City of Kansas City, 235 Kan. 278, 680 P.2d 877 (1984); Tuley v. Kansas   City Power & Light Co., 252 Kan. 205, 843 P.2d 248 (1992). In Tuley, an employee suffering damage to his   automobile due to the negligent acts of the employer was held to have assumed the risk where the employee   voluntarily exposed his property to a known danger.

Reasonable care requires all   persons who use the streets and highways to obey the rules of the road. You   must decide from the evidence whether any of the following rules apply in this   case and whether any rules have been violated. The violation of any of these   rules is negligence.      Notes on Use      The court should give this instruction immediately before the court instructs the jury about the   applicable rules of the road.      Comment      The following quotation from Blakeman v. Lofland, 173 Kan. 725, 252 P.2d 852 (1953), points   out the duty of the court to determine whether or not the evidence warrants the giving of a particular   instruction:     “Instructions should fairly present the law applicable to the theory of the parties   to the case. . . .[O]rdinarily it is the duty of the trial court to instruct on the sections of the   motor vehicle act applicable to the facts established by the evidence.” 173 Kan. at 732.

As a general rule, where statutory provisions are quoted and contain words defined in the statute, the   jury should be instructed as to those definitions. Long v. Shafer, 162 Kan. 21, 174 P.2d 88 (1946). In the   Long case, it was held the refusal of the trial court to define the words “roadway” and “intersection” was   not error in the light of the evidence. Obvious definitions are not needed in motor vehicle instructions   and should be included only when a genuine issue is presented by the evidence as to whether or not a   statute applies, for example, when evidence is conflicting on whether or not an area involved constituted an   “intersection.” No instruction is submitted on this subject as the definitions are self-explanatory and they   will be rarely applicable, depending on the issues and evidence.       2010      "      2014      IHI.

Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 8-1507. See introductory instruction PIK 4" , Violation of Law   Constitutes Negligence, and Notes on Use. The statute grants an exception to a driver of an authorized   emergency vehicle. For exceptions granted emergency vehicles see PIK 4" , Authorized Emergency   Vehicles—Privileges—Conditions.     Traffic control signal is defined in K.S.A. 8-1478.      Comment      Ifthe traffic control device is not in a proper position or sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily   observant person, the applicable provision of the uniform traffic act should not be enforced. See K.S.A.   8-1507(b). This could involve a contested issue of fact requiring appropriate instructions to be given to   the jury. In this respect two recent presumptions have been provided by statute in K.S.A. 8-1507(c) and   (d). The first presumption provides that whenever an official traffic control device is placed in position   approximately conforming to the requirements of the traffic act, then the device shall be presumed to have   been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful authority, unless the contrary shall be established by   competent evidence. The second presumption states that when any official traffic control device is placed   pursuant to the uniform act and purports to conform to the lawful requirements for the device, then the   device shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of the uniform act, unless the contrary shall be   established by competent evidence.     Amber lights placed upon a highway construction or maintenance vehicle are traffic control devices   under K.S.A. 8-1507(a).

F. Signals Placed other than at Intersection      When an official traffic control signal is placed somewhere other than   an intersection and a stop is required, the driver must stop at a sign or at a   marking on the pavement which indicates where the stop should be made or   at the signal if there is no sign or marking.

The court in Kendrick v. Manda, 38 Kan. App. 2d 864, 174 P.3d 432 (2008), clarified that a bicycle   is not defined as a vehicle for purposes of the Rules of the Road in Kansas, nor is a bicyclist defined as a   pedestrian. However, if a bicyclist operates a bicycle on a roadway, the bicyclist has the same rights and   duties applicable to drivers of vehicles. Likewise, if a bicyclist uses a sidewalk, the bicyclist has the same      rights as a pedestrian and is not subject to vehicular traffic laws. See also Schallenberger v.

The 75 mile-per-hour speed limit   noted in part B only applies to cases arising on or after July 1, 2011. Prior to July 1, 2011, the appropriate   speed limit was 70 miles per hour.      2012                              "      Rural interstate highways are highways outside urbanized areas. Urbanized areas are designated as   such by the Bureau of Census, and state and local authorities (23 U.S.C. 101).     The Secretary of Transportation and local authorities may establish the speed limits within road   construction zones under their respective jurisdictions. The speed limit is effective when appropriate signs   giving notice thereof are erected. “Road construction zone” means the portion of a highway that is identified   as having a construction or maintenance work area. The zone starts at the first sign identifying the zone and   continues until a posted or moving sign indicates that the road construction zone has ended.

The driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, when (responding to   an emergency call) (in the pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law)   (responding to, but not upon returning from, a fire alarm), may exercise the   privilege to (insert appropriate phrase from below).      e park or stand      e proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after slowing   down as may be necessary for safe operation      e exceed the maximum speed limits so long as (he) (she) does not   endanger life or property      e disregard regulations governing direction of movement or turning   in specified directions      B. The privilege granted to the driver of an authorized emergency   vehicle shall apply only when the vehicle is making use of a (siren) (whistle)   (bell) that is capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from   a distance of not less than 500 feet and of a type approved by the Secretary   of Transportation and (visual signal lamps mounted as high and as widely   spaced laterally as practicable, which shall be capable of displaying to the front   two alternately flashing red lights located at the same level and to the rear two   alternately flashing red lights located at the same level) (one rotating or oscillating   light, which shall be mounted as high as practicable on such vehicle and which   shall display to the front and rear of such vehicle [a flashing red light] [alternate   flashes of red and white lights in combination] [alternate flashes of red and blue   lights in combination]) and these lights shall have sufficient intensity to be   visible at five hundred feet in normal sunlight. [A police vehicle when used   as an emergency vehicle, may but need not be, equipped with (here enter   appropriate description of lamps or lights from K.S.A. 8-1720 or 8-1722).]      C. The privilege does not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency   vehicle of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of others. The   operation of the emergency vehicle [, including the decision to initiate or   continue a pursuit] may not be done in reckless disregard for the safety of   others.      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 8-1506. For a definition of “authorized emergency vehicle,” see K.S.A.   8-1404.      2014                   See introductory instruction PIK 4 , Violation of Law Constitutes Negligence, and Notes on   Use.      Parts A, B, and C should be given in all cases involving an authorized emergency vehicle. The   appropriate parentheticals under parts A and B that are applicable from the evidence should be selected.      Under part B, the contents of the applicable audible signal under K.S.A. 8-1738 and the visual   signals under K.S.A. 8-1720 have been included.     Part C was amended to reflect the Supreme Court’s holding in Robbins v. City of Wichita, 285 Kan.   455, 172 P.3d 1187 (2007).      Comment      The standard of care required of the driver of an emergency police vehicle is the standard of care   of a reasonable man in the discharge of official duties of a like nature under like circumstances. Scogin v.   Nugen, 204 Kan. 568, 464 P.2d 166 (1970).     When a police vehicle is used as an authorized emergency vehicle, appropriate changes in the   instruction may be necessary in view of K.S.A. 8-1506(c) and 8-1722(d).     In Shawnee Township Fire District v. Morgan, 221 Kan. 271, 278, 559 P.2d 1141 (1977), it was held   that the phrase “ordinary negligence” is no longer applicable to the driver of an emergency vehicle and   should not be used in instructions to the jury in actions involving emergency vehicles. The test of due care   as applied to the driver of an emergency vehicle is whether, with the privileges and immunities provided   by statute, he or she acted as a reasonably careful driver. The holding of the court in Scogin v. Nugen, 204   Kan. 568, 464 P.2d 166 (1970) was modified in view of the adoption of K.S.A. 8-1530.     In Robbins v. City of Wichita, 285 Kan. 455, 172 P.3d 1187 (2007), the Supreme Court held that the   “due care” required of a police officer driving an authorized emergency vehicle (K.S.A. 8-1506[d]) applies   not only to the officer’s physical operation of the vehicle, but also to the decision to chase or continue to   chase a law violator. The court went on to state that the standard of care for evaluating whether the driver   of an emergency vehicle breached the statutory duty to drive with due regard for the safety of others is   “reckless disregard.” The Supreme Court further cited with approval the definition found in PIK 3d 70.04,   Reckless Driving [now PIK 4" 66.060].     K.S.A. 8-1506 does not grant absolute immunity to emergency vehicle drivers but does grant certain   privileges not available to others. Although not one of the privileges enumerated in K.S.A. 8-1506(b)(4)   and (d), the legislature intended to permit an authorized emergency vehicle to pass in a no passing zone,   so long as such passing does not endanger the safety of others. State v. Simpson, 11 Kan. App. 2d 666, 732   P.2d 788 (1987).     In Littell v. Maloney, 3 Kan. App. 2d 240, 593 P.2d 11 (1979), it was determined that the operator of   an authorized emergency vehicle who is responding to an emergency call is granted special privileges of   the statute only when the operator is making use of the audible signal required under K.S.A. 8-1506 and 8-   1738(d). This case involved a police officer on a motorcycle directing traffic for a funeral procession who   was not sounding a siren when struck by an automobile. The court stated that since the motorcycle was not   being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on the   test of due care for a driver of an emergency vehicle or on the duty of a motorist to yield to an emergency   vehicle.

Prohibited Use of Signal Lamps      Signals required on vehicles shall not be flashed on one side only on a   disabled vehicle, flashed as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to operators of   other vehicles approaching from the rear, nor be flashed on one side only of a   parked vehicle except as may be necessary.

Bayer, 204 Kan. 509, 464 P.2d 233 (1970), plaintiff suddenly applied his brakes when   coming upon a road barricade at night and was struck from behind by defendant’s auto. The court held   that the sufficiency of the brake lights as an “appropriate signal” under the statute was a jury question. The   court followed the rule as announced in Johnston v. Ecord, 196 Kan. 521, 412 P.2d 990 (1966), where a   decedent suddenly applied his brakes to avoid hitting a dog in the road and was struck by a following auto,   and held what constitutes an “appropriate signal” under the statute depends on the necessity for, and the   driver’s opportunity to give, an effective warning commensurate with the probable hazards revealed under   the circumstances of the particular case.      Where the sudden decrease in the speed of a vehicle is actually observed without a signal, the party   observing the decrease in speed has the same notice a signal would have imparted if given at that time, and   the absence of a signal cannot be said to have been the cause of the collision.

DeMarco, 263 Kan. 727, 952 P.2d 1276 (1998), the court held that under K.S.A. 8-1548,   a lane change signal must be made within 100 feet of the point where the vehicle makes the lane change,      regardless of whether there is any traffic moving in front of or behind the vehicle.      2012                   "      <h4><a name='121.27' href='121.27'>121.27</a></h4><p>METHOD OF GIVING SIGNALS      A.

Parts C and D should be given only   when the evidence warrants its submission to the jury.     The above instruction reflects legislative changes in K.S.A. 8-1549 and 8-1708(b) which makes it   mandatory that turn signals be given by electric turn signals except in those situations covered in part C.     The 1974 version of K.S.A. 8-1549 specifically authorized both stop and turn signals to be given   by hand and arm or by signal lamps. All authorization concerning stopping signals has been deleted from   K.S.A. 8-1549. K.S.A. 8-1548 now provides that “[n]o person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of a   vehicle without first giving an appropriate signal, in the manner provided herein ... “ The Committee is of the   opinion that despite this legislative oversight that electric stop signals would be held to be appropriate.      2012      "       Comment      The methods of giving hand and arm signals were considered in Baze v. Groff, 205 Kan. 736, 473   P.2d 59 (1970).     Kuhl v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rwy. Co., 250 Kan. 332, 340, 827 P.2d 1 (1992) held that it was   appropriate to instruct the jury on the method of giving signals when there was a factual question whether   the accident would have occurred if the defendant driver had signaled her intention to turn or stop.      2012                   VII.

The right of way rule is modified at through highways pursuant   to K.S.A. 8-1526(b).      Comment      Facts disclosed an “intersection” and justified the giving of an instruction based upon K.S.A. 8-550   [antecedent of K.S.A. 8-1526] in Cherry v. State Automobile Insurance Association, 181 Kan. 205, 310   P.2d 907 (1957).      When the evidence presents an issue as to whether or not the area involved in the case constitutes an   “intersection,” see K.S.A. 8-1428 for the statutory definition.      Where evidence disclosed a street controlled by stop signs crossed a through street, it was held error   to instruct on the right of way provisions applicable to an intersection of two ordinary streets. Heiserman v.   Aikman, 163 Kan. 700, 186 P.2d 252 (1947).     Courts have occasionally attempted to explain or qualify the right of way statute by additional   instructions. For example, see the instructions set out in Byas v. Dodge City Rendering Co., 177 Kan. 337,   279 P.2d 252 (1955) on page of the opinion. The Committee does not recommend such instructions,   for the reason that the application of the law to the facts of the case is a matter more properly left to counsel   in his or her argument to the jury.     In Meyer v. Stone, 6 Kan. App. 2d 254, 627 P.2d 1155 (1981), it was held to be reversible error for   the trial court to instruct the jury that, if a driver stopped at an open intersection, that driver had a duty to   yield the right of way.

Comment      In Kuhl v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rwy. Co., 250 Kan. 332, 340, 827 P.2d 1 (1992), it was   held that the failure of the trial court to give PIK 2d 8.28 [PIK 4" ] was not error because, under the   evidence, the defendant’s failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic was not an issue in the case   which involved a rear end collision.     In Dawson v. Griffin, 249 Kan. 115, 816 P.2d 374 (1991), the court held that a driver of a vehicle   intending to turn to the left may not delegate the duty to yield the right of way imposed by K.S.A. 8-1527   to a phantom truck driver.     Dawson was cited and applied by the court in Downing v. Kingsley, 43 Kan. App. 2d 30, 35, 221   P.3d 115 (2009), in which the court held that the duty to yield the right of way could not be delegated, and   the driver could not rely on a hand gesture of another vehicle operator waving the driver on through the   intersection.       2014      "      2012      <h4><a name='121.31' href='121.31'>121.31</a></h4><p>ENTERING THROUGH HIGHWAY—STOP SIGNS      Every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop (at a clearly   marked stop line, if there is one) (before entering the crosswalk on the near side   of the intersection, if there is no clearly marked stop line) (at the point nearest   the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on   the intersecting roadway before entering it, if there is no crosswalk at the near   side of the intersection).

Comment      If the motorist on a secondary or servient road knows that he is approaching a favored street or   highway, the fact that the stop sign is obscured or obliterated or has become illegible is immaterial in   respect to his negligence in failing to stop or otherwise recognize the preferential character of the favored   highway. See Schenck v. Thompson, 201 Kan. 608, 443 P.2d 298 (1968).     The rights and duties of drivers approaching an intersection with stop or yield signs were discussed   in Harbaugh v.

In McGlothlin the court held that a definition of   the term “immediate hazard” was not required.     In Meyer v. Stone, 6 Kan. App. 2d 254, 255, 627 P.2d 1155 (1981), the court held that PIK 2d 8.29   and 8.30 [PIK 4th  and ] should not be given where the intersection is not controlled by stop   signs or yield signs.

Comment      The Committee believes that no instruction should be given relating to the prima facie evidence   provision as contained in K.S.A. 8-1528(c). The statutory provision refers to a rule of evidence and not to a   presumption of negligence. Accordingly, its only application should be in determining whether as a matter   of law there is sufficient evidence to justify the submission of the case to the jury under the theory of a   failure to yield the right of way.     The duty of a driver to stop or yield before entering an intersection is discussed in Revell v. Bennett,   162 Kan. 345, 176 P.2d 538 (1947).     A driver approaching a “yield” sign must stop before entering an intersection and yield the right of   way if an approaching vehicle is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard. The law of “stop” sign cases   is applicable. Harbaugh v. Darr, 200 Kan. 610, 438 P.2d 74 (1968).     In Meyer v. Stone, 6 Kan. App. 2d 254, 255, 627 P.2d 1155 (1981), the court held that PIK 2d 8.29   and 8.30 [PIK 4"  and ] should not be given where the intersection is not controlled by stop   signs or yield signs.      2012      "      2012      <h4><a name='121.33' href='121.33'>121.33</a></h4><p>ENTERING ROADWAY—NOT AT INTERSECTION      The driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any   place other than another roadway shall yield the right of way to all vehicles   approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed.

Goetz, 211 Kan. 126, 505 P.2d 726 (1973), the court construed the words “at all other   places” as contained in K.S.A. 8-555 and concerning duties of pedestrians with control signals to refer to   places on public highways with no traffic control signals. The same words are present in K.S.A. 8-1532(c)   that replaced K.S.A. 8-555.      The court in Kendrick v. Manda, 38 Kan. App. 2d 864, 174 P.3d 432 (2008), clarified that a bicycle   is not defined as a vehicle for purposes of the Rules of the Road in Kansas, nor is a bicyclist defined as a   pedestrian. However, if a bicyclist operates a bicycle on a roadway, the bicyclist has the same rights and   duties applicable to drivers of vehicles.

Comment      Language similar to that used in K.S.A. 8-1541(b) has been construed by the Kansas Supreme Court.   In Robbins v. City of Wichita, 285 Kan. 455, 172 P.3d 1187 (2007), the Supreme Court held that the “due   care” required of a police officer driving an authorized emergency vehicle pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1506(d)   applies not only to the officer’s physical operation of the vehicle, but also to the decision to chase or   continue to chase a law violator. The court went on to state that the standard of care for evaluating whether   the driver of an emergency vehicle breached the statutory duty to drive with due regard for the safety of   others is “reckless disregard.” The Supreme Court further cited with approval the definition found in PIK   3d 70.04, Reckless Driving [now PIK 4" 66.060].

K.S.A. 8-570 [antecedent of K.S.A. 8-1569] was discussed, and a violation of it was held to constitute   negligence, in McElhaney v. Rouse, 197 Kan. 136, 141, 142, 415 P.2d 241 (1966).     In Lutz v. Peine, 209 Kan. 559, 498 P.2d 60 (1972), the defendant drove into the rear of a parked   pickup in which plaintiff was asleep. The court held that plaintiff was free of contributory negligence as   a matter of law in that the record disclosed no evidence that plaintiff violated any duty or law as to the   manner in which the truck was parked.     The provisions of K.S.A. 8-570(a) [antecedent of K.S.A. 8-1569] have no application to an automobile   that is involuntarily stopped on a highway contrary to the will of the driver. Fairbanks v.

A person (riding [a bicycle] [a motorcycle] [an animal]) (driving any   animal-drawn vehicle) has the same obligations and is entitled to the same   protection under the law as other persons in vehicles upon the highway.      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 8-1593, which provides that traffic laws apply to persons operating   motorcycles, K.S.A. 8-1504, which provides that traffic laws apply to persons riding an animal or driving   any animal-drawn vehicle upon a road, and K.S.A. 8-1587, which provides that traffic laws apply to persons   riding bicycles.

Hawkeye Casualty Co., 168 Kan. 303, 212 P.2d 633 (1949) that persons   riding bicycles have the same rights and are entitled to the same protection as persons in vehicles upon the   highway.     In Conrad v. Dillinger, 176 Kan. 296, 270 P.2d 216 (1954), the Kansas Supreme Court held that   “vehicle” is sufficiently broad to cover a ridden animal. In this case it was also held that a person riding   an animal upon a highway is subject to the Vehicle Laws applicable to a vehicle driver and consequently   horses must have tail lights if ridden at night.      The court in Kendrick v. Manda, 38 Kan. App. 2d 864, 174 P.3d 432 (2008), clarified that a bicycle   is not defined as a vehicle for purposes of the Rules of the Road in Kansas, nor is a bicyclist defined as a   pedestrian. However, if a bicyclist operates a bicycle on a roadway, the bicyclist has the same rights and   duties applicable to drivers of vehicles. Likewise, if a bicyclist uses a sidewalk, the bicyclist has the same   rights as a pedestrian and is not subject to vehicular traffic laws. See also Schallenberger v.

A bicyclist may legally use the sidewalks, and, if the bicyclist was using the sidewalks, she had   the right of way in using the crosswalk.      2012 1      "      <h4><a name='121.76' href='121.76'>121.76</a></h4><p>BICYCLES—EQUIPMENT      A.

Each is entitled to rely on this assumption until (he)   (she) has knowledge to the contrary.      Notes on Use      This instruction is sufficiently broad to cover any vehicular negligence case involving drivers or   pedestrians.      Comment      The word “law” as used in the first sentence of the instruction refers to duties imposed by both the   common law and by statute. See PIK 4" , Violation of Law Constitutes Negligence, and Notes on   Use.     The rule stated in the instruction was discussed and applied in Gardner v. Pereboom, 197 Kan.   188, 416 P.2d 67 (1966), and in Borggren v. Liebling, 198 Kan. 161, 422 P.2d 884 (1967). The rule is also   supported by the following cases: Kelty v. Best Cabs, Inc., 206 Kan. 654, 481 P.2d 980 (1971); Logan v.   McPhail, 208 Kan. 770, 494 P.2d 1191 (1972); Lehar v. Rogers, 208 Kan. 831, 494 P.2d 1124 (1972); and   Hallett v. Stone, 216 Kan. 568, 534 P.2d 232 (1975).      One driving on a highway protected by “yield” signs has the right to assume that vehicles approaching   on intersecting highways will stop or yield the right of way at intersections, and the driver on the protected   highway is not negligent in acting upon this assumption until he has knowledge to the contrary. Harbaugh   v. Darr, 200 Kan. 610, 438 P.2d 74 (1968).     The driver of an automobile with the right of way at an intersection may assume that others will   comply with the law, but he is not absolved from the consequences of his own independent negligence in   keeping a proper lookout. Morris v. Hoesch, 204 Kan. 735, 466 P.2d 272 (1970).     A passenger has the equal right to assume that other motorists will observe the rules of the road.   Kelty v. Best Cabs, Inc., 206 Kan. 654, 481 P.2d 980 (1971).      2012 7            "      <h4><a name='121.86' href='121.86'>121.86</a></h4><p>EMERGENCY      The Committee recommends that no instruction be given on the doctrine   of sudden emergency.      Comment      The recommendation is based on Mesecher v. Cropp, 213 Kan. 695, 518 P.2d 504 (1974), wherein   the Supreme Court of Kansas questioned the continued practice of giving the instruction. In that case the   court referred to the theory and problems its use presented as reflected in the cases of Lawrence v. Deemy,   204 Kan. 299, 461 P.2d 770 (1969) and Kline v. Emmele, 204 Kan. 629, 465 P.2d 970 (1970).      In Lawrence v. Deemy, 204 Kan. 299, 461 P.2d 770 (1969), the court observed that the doctrine   could not be considered apart from the fundamental rule that everyone is under a duty to exercise ordinary   care and that a claim under the doctrine was but a denial of negligence. It reasoned that the emergency   circumstances were merely a factor to be considered in determining the reasonable character of the action   taken and whether the choice was negligent. In Kline v. Emmele, 204 Kan. 629, 465 P.2d 970 (1970), the   court approved the trial court’s refusal to give the instruction. In Hallett v. Stone, 216 Kan. 568, 534 P.2d   232 (1975), the trial court was reversed, in part, for giving an instruction on the doctrine.     The Committee believes there is no valid justification for the continued giving of the instruction.   However, the emergency circumstances are a proper matter for argument by counsel.     In Bayer v. Shupe Bros. Co., 223 Kan. 668, 671, 576 P.2d 1078 (1978), the Supreme Court noted the   doctrine of sudden emergency is properly one for argument by counsel and held it was not error to refuse   to give an instruction on sudden emergency.      8      2012      "       <h4><a name='121.87' href='121.87'>121.87</a></h4><p>UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT      The Committee recommends that no instruction be given on the doctrine   of unavoidable accident.      Comment      The recommendation that no unavoidable accident instruction be given is based on several compelling   reasons. First, the instruction is misleading to a jury when informed that a defendant is not responsible for   the consequences of an “accident.” See Kreh v. Trinkle, 185 Kan. 329, 343 P.2d 213 (1959).     Second, the theory of the typical unavoidable accident instruction is inherently illogical. The term   “accident” carries an implication that negligence is not involved. It logically follows that the foundation for   an accident instruction exists only when the court can say there is no evidence of a negligent act or omission   of one or the other, or both, of the parties in the action. In such instance the claim or defense of the party   having the burden of proving negligence on the part of the other fails as a matter of law and the issue of   negligence must be withdrawn from consideration by the jury.     Third, the trend has been to disapprove unavoidable accident instructions where negligence, burden   of proof, and cause have been properly defined in the instructions. See Herrington v. Pechin, 198 Kan. 431,   424 P.2d 624 (1967); Curby v. Ulysses Irrigation Pipe Co., Inc., 204 Kan. 456, 464 P.2d 245 (1970). In   Kline v. Emmele, 204 Kan. 629, 465 P.2d 970 (1970), the trial court properly refused to give an instruction   on unavoidable accident where the defendant’s brakes suddenly failed.      2012 9            "      <h4><a name='121.88' href='121.88'>121.88</a></h4><p>LAST CLEAR CHANCE      The Committee recommends no instruction be given on the doctrine of   last clear chance.      Comment      The Committee believes that no instruction on the doctrine of last clear chance should be given   in comparative negligence actions. The purpose of comparative negligence is to allow apportionment on   the basis of fault. The doctrine of last clear chance evolved to moderate the harshness of contributory   negligence. It admits that the plaintiff has been negligent but that his negligence has ceased. Thus, it is a   modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence. With the abolition of contributory negligence as an   absolute bar to recovery, it would appear that the factual matters should be a circumstance to be considered   in determining the relative fault of the parties. For the rare case that might arise prior to July 1, 1974, when   comparative negligence was adopted, see PIK 8.83, first edition (1966).     In Southard v. Lira, 212 Kan. 763, 512 P.2d 409 (1973), the Kansas Supreme Court held that a   defendant may not rely upon the doctrine of last clear chance.      0      2012      "       <h4><a name='121.89' href='121.89'>121.89</a></h4><p>INTOXICATION—UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF   INTOXICATING LIQUOR OR DRUGS      A.

The applicable category should be selected.     K.S.A. 8-1543 provides that a pedestrian who is under the influence of alcohol or any drug to a degree   which renders the person a hazard shall not walk or be upon a highway. The Committee recommends that   no separate instruction be given on this statute since “under the influence” is adequately covered by this   instruction. In cases arising prior to July 1, 2011, the B.A.T. was required to be performed within two hours   after the defendant operated or attempted to operate a vehicle.      Comment      The phrase “driving under the influence” is not unconstitutionally vague. State v. Campbell, 9 Kan.   App. 2d 474, 475, 681 P.2d 679 (1984). In Townsend v. Jones, 183 Kan. 543, 548, 331 P.2d 890 (1958),   intoxication of a pedestrian was held not to constitute negligence per se, but is relevant upon the issue of   care and caution.     The court in State v. Larson, 12 Kan. App. 2d 198, 737 P.2d 880 (1987), held that K.S.A. 8-1567(a)(1)   creates a new crime of driving with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of .10 or above, regardless   whether the driver is under the influence of alcohol to the extent he or she is incapable of driving safely.   See also State v. Zito, 11 Kan. App. 2d 432, 724 P.2d 149 (1986).      The provisions of K.S.A. 8-1567 were held constitutional in State v. Larson, 12 Kan. App. 2d 198,   737 P.2d 880 (1987); City of Overland Park v. Denning, 12 Kan. App. 2d 375, 744 P.2d 523 (1987); and   City of Ottawa v. Brown, 11 Kan. App. 2d 581, 730 P.2d 364 (1986).     The court in City of Wichita v. Hull, 11 Kan. App. 2d 441, 724 P.2d 699 (1986), made clear that   driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of K.S.A. 8-1567 is an absolute liability offense;   thus intent is not an element.      2 2012      "      2012      <h4><a name='121.90' href='121.90'>121.90</a></h4><p>GUEST STATUTE      The guest statute is no longer applicable.      Comment      The Kansas guest statute as set forth in K.S.A. 8-122b was held unconstitutional and void as a denial   of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and   Sections | and 2 of the Kansas Bill of Rights for the reason that the classifications provided in the statute   were arbitrary and discriminatory and had no rational basis. See Henry v. Bauder, 213 Kan. 751, 518 P.2d   362 (1974). Thereafter, the guest statute was repealed by the Legislature of Kansas in Chapter 32, 1974   Session Laws of Kansas.            3            "      <h4><a name='121.91' href='121.91'>121.91</a></h4><p>NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT—UNDERAGE DRIVER      An owner of a motor vehicle causing or knowingly permitting a minor   under the age of sixteen years to drive a vehicle upon a highway, or any person   who gives or furnishes a motor vehicle to a minor under the age of sixteen,   shall be liable (with the minor) for any damages caused by the negligence of   the minor in driving the vehicle.      Notes on Use      This instruction is a paraphrase of K.S.A. 8-222. The parenthetical reference should be used if the   action is against both the furnishing person and the minor.

If the cause of action is framed   under K.S.A. 8-264 (permitting an unlicensed person to drive a vehicle), the instruction should also be   modified as applicable.      Comment      In Smithson v. Dunham, 201 Kan. 455, 441 P.2d 823 (1968), the Kansas Supreme Court held that the   negligence of a restricted driver under K.S.A. 8-237 was imputed to and barred recovery by his passenger   parent against a driver of another vehicle. In Upland Mutual Insurance, Inc. v. Noel, 214 Kan. 145, 519 P.2d   737 (1974), the Kansas Supreme Court held that an exclusion clause in the homeowner’s liability insurance   policy was limited in scope to cases where the claim was based directly and necessarily upon negligence   in the ownership, maintenance, operation and use of an automobile, and did not extend to a cause of action   based upon the theory of negligent entrustment of an automobile to a known careless and reckless driver.   The reader is referred to the Comment in PIK 4" , Negligent Entrustment—Incompetent Driver.      In Yetsko v. Panure, 272 Kan. 741, 750, 35 P.3d 904 (2001), the Supreme Court concluded that the   operation of K.S.A. 8-222 was not altered or negated by the adoption of comparative fault.      4      2014      "      2014      <h4><a name='121.92' href='121.92'>121.92</a></h4><p>NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT—INCOMPETENT DRIVER      A person who furnishes a motor vehicle to a person (he) (she) knows,   or had reasonable cause to know, to be an incompetent driver, is liable (with   the driver) for any damages caused by the negligence of the driver in the   operation of the vehicle.      Notes on Use      The phrase in parenthesis should be used if the action is against both the entruster and the driver.      Reference should be made to PIK 4" , Negligent Entrustment—Underage Driver, if the case   is framed under the provisions of K.S.A. 8-222, 8-263, or 8-264.      Comment      The theory of liability under negligent entrustment is well recognized in Kansas. See Priestly v.   Skourup, 142 Kan. 127, 45 P.2d 852 (1935); Richardson v. Erwin, 174 Kan. 314, 255 P.2d 641 (1953); Fogo,   Administratrix v. Steele, 180 Kan. 326, 304 P.2d 451 (1956); and Upland Mutual Insurance, Inc. v. Noel, 214   Kan. 145, 519 P.2d 737 (1974). In Upland the court stated that “the rationale of the ‘negligent entrustment’   cases is not founded upon the negligence of the driver of the automobile but upon the primary negligence   of the entruster in supplying the chattel, an automobile, to an incompetent and reckless driver.”     In Priestly v. Skourup, 142 Kan. 127, 45 P.2d 852 (1935), a cause of action under negligent entrustment   was upheld where a father permitted his son, an incompetent, careless and reckless driver, to operate his   car, which struck a pedestrian.     In Richardson v. Erwin, 174 Kan. 314, 255 P.2d 641 (1953), a cause of action was not stated against   a father under negligent entrustment where the son had been absolved of negligence.     In Fogo, Administratrix v. Steele, 180 Kan. 326, 304 P.2d 451 (1956), a mother was held responsible   for the negligence of her 20-year-old son by permitting him to drive her car with the knowledge that he was   an incompetent, careless and reckless driver.     The authorities above cited generally stand for the proposition that an incompetent person means   one, who by reason of age, experience, physical or mental condition, or known habits of recklessness, is   incapable of operating a vehicle with ordinary care.     This instruction was cited with approval in Tran v. Nguyen, 44 Kan. App. 2d 443, 238 P.3d 314   (2010).     In Yetsko v. Panure, 272 Kan. 741, 750, 35 P.3d 904 (2001), the Supreme Court concluded that the   operation of K.S.A. 8-222 was not altered or negated by the adoption of comparative fault.            5      "      <h4><a name='121.93' href='121.93'>121.93</a></h4><p>FAILURE TO USE SEAT BELTS—COMPARATIVE FAULT OR   FAILURE TO MITIGATE DAMAGES      Comment      The Committee recommends that no instruction be given.     The provisions of K.S.A. 8-1749 require that all passenger cars manufactured and assembled after   certain dates be equipped with seat belts.     K.S.A. 8-2501 et seq., the Safety Belt Use Act, provides the occupants of the front seat of passenger   cars or autocycles equipped with safety belts shall wear them unless the occupant is: (1) excused for   medical reasons; (2) a United States mail carrier delivering or collecting mail; or (3) a newspaper carrier   delivering papers. Passengers 14 through 17 years of age must wear safety belts at all times when the   passenger car is in motion.     K.S.A. 8-2504(c) provides: “Evidence of failure of any person to use a safety belt shall not be   admissible in any action for the purpose of determining any aspect of comparative negligence or mitigation   of damages.”      6 2016      "       E.

Comment      The rule is well established in this jurisdiction that the negligence of a driver is not imputed to one   who is riding in an automobile as a passenger. Kendrick v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 182 Kan. 249, 320   P.2d 1061 (1958). In Schmidt v. Martin, 212 Kan. 373, 510 P.2d 1244 (1973), the Kansas Supreme Court   gave an exhaustive analysis of the doctrine of imputed negligence and stated “This court from an early date   has been highly critical of the doctrine of imputed negligence, pointing out that it is a fiction of the law   which finds small favor with the courts.” In that case the court held that in the absence of a true agency   relationship, the negligence of a third person caring for a child at the parent’s request will not be imputed   to the parent.     In Southard v. Lira, 212 Kan. 763, 512 P.2d 409 (1973), the court held that “an agency relationship,   aside from joint venture or partnership, which will justify the imputation of a driver’s negligence to his   passenger, must be of a master and servant or employer and employee type and further that an ordinary ‘car   pool’ or ‘share-the-ride’ agreement is not a contract between the parties which constitutes the driver of an   automobile the agent of the passenger.”     For an example of illustrative instructions involving multiple drivers and passengers, see PIK 4"   , Illustrative Instructions.      In Lightner v. Frank, 240 Kan. 21, 727 P.2d 430 (1986), the court commented:      “The doctrine of imputed negligence is now approved in Kansas only when applied to two   special relationships — the master-servant relationship and joint enterprise. . . .[t]he only   logical basis for the imputation of the negligence of one person to another is the right of the   latter to control the acts of the former.” 240 Kan. at 26.      See also PIK 4" , Negligence of Driver Imputed to Passenger—Agency and Joint Enterprise.      2014 7      "      <h4><a name='121.95' href='121.95'>121.95</a></h4><p>DUTY OF VEHICLE PASSENGER      If a passenger has knowledge of danger and the circumstances are such   that an ordinary person would speak out or take other positive action to   avoid injury to (himself) (herself), then it is (his) (her) duty to do what the   ordinary person would do under the circumstances. Unless such knowledge   and circumstances exist, (he) (she) may rely upon the driver to attend to the   operation of the vehicle.      Notes on Use      This instruction is to be used when the claim of the passenger is against a wrongdoer other than   his own driver. PIK 4 , Negligence of Driver Not Imputed to Passenger, should precede this   instruction.     For cases when negligence is imputed to a passenger, see PIK 4" , Negligence of Driver   Imputed to Passenger—Agency and Joint Enterprise.      Comment      The following Kansas cases discuss various aspects of the duty of a passenger. Curtiss v. Fahle, 157   Kan. 226, 139 P.2d 827 (1943) states that when a passenger has an equal opportunity to observe dangerous   conditions, the circumstances may be such as to make it the duty of the passenger to warn or to attempt to   control the driver’s conduct. In general, the passenger’s duty is to use due care for his own safety.     Henderson v. National Mutual Cas. Co., 166 Kan. 576, 203 P.2d 250 (1949) states the rule to be that   a passenger in an automobile is required to exercise due care for his own safety. Whether the conduct of a   passenger was that of an ordinary reasonable man is for the jury.      Beye v. Andres, 179 Kan. 502, 296 P.2d 1049 (1956) states the general rule that a passenger has a   duty to exercise reasonable care for his own safety and that under the evidence the question of contributory   negligence of a passenger is one for the jury.     Rupe v. Smith, 181 Kan. 606, 313 P.2d 293 (1957) quoted an early Kansas case and held a passenger   is not negligent as a matter of law because he was asleep at the beginning of the mishap resulting in his   injury. The following comment from the Restatement, Torts, 495, Comment c (1934) was quoted:     “Save in exceptional situations, a guest or passenger in a vehicle is not required to keep   a constant lookout or to see to it that he shall be in a condition to do so. Thus, a plaintiff   riding in the front seat may take his attention off the road to look at the scenery or may   turn around to speak to a friend in the back or he may go to sleep or read a book without   being guilty of contributory negligence if the driver commits some negligent act which   the plaintiff, had he been on the alert, might have had the opportunity to prevent... “     Kendrick v. Atchison, T. & S. F R. Co., 182 Kan. 249, 320 P.2d 1061 (1958) reviews a number of   cases and points out that the test applied to determine the duty of a passenger has varied somewhat over the   years. This case states: “The plaintiff, a passenger, could only be contributorily negligent by: (1) a failure to   use due care for his own safety ... [and] (2) under joint enterprise where the negligence of the driver would   be imputed to him.”      8 2012      "      2016      The Committee believes the instruction is consistent with the Kansas law considering the varied   pronouncements on the subject. The instruction is consistent with the concept of comparative fault (PIK   4 ), and with the accepted rule that one has the right to assume others will obey the law (PIK 4"   ).     In McGlothlin v. Wiles, 207 Kan. 718, 487 P.2d 533 (1971), the court compared the duty of a   passenger with her driver and held that the care imposed on a passenger in the back seat of a vehicle is not   commensurate with that required of the driver. A passenger, as a general rule, may properly rely upon the   driver to attend to the operation of the car in the absence of knowledge of danger or of facts that would give   him such knowledge.      In Kelty v. Best Cabs, Inc., 206 Kan. 654, 481 P.2d 980 (1971), the court held that the trial court   properly refused to submit the issue of a passenger’s negligence to the jury where a taxicab suddenly drove   in front of a car in which the plaintiff was riding.     In Smith v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 222 Kan. 303, 307, 564 P.2d 514 (1977), the court approved the   giving of PIK 8.91 [antecedent of PIK 4" ] and held that a passenger in a vehicle is not contributorily   negligent as a matter of law when approaching a railroad track if he or she fails to keep a lookout and warn   the driver of any danger.     The court in Akins v. Hamblin, 237 Kan. 742, 703 P.2d 771 (1985), held 8.91 [PIK 4% ] applies   only where there is a question as to the duty of care a passenger should use for his or her own protection.   The court noted it had never been recognized in Kansas that a passenger owes a duty to other passengers   or third parties, unless the passenger and driver were involved in a joint enterprise or unless the passenger   and driver had a special relationship that created a duty.      In Siruta v. Siruta, 301 Kan. 757, 348 P.3d 549 (2015), a mother was the driver of a vehicle in which   her child and the child’s father were passengers. The vehicle was involved in a one-car rollover accident   resulting in the child’s death. The father sued the mother for wrongful death of the child. He did not sue for   his own injuries. The trial court instructed the jury to compare the fault of the father. The Supreme Court   held that PIK 4%  goes only to a passenger’s duty to avoid injury to himself, not to a passenger’s   duties to other passengers. Comparing a passenger’s negligence is appropriate only if the negligence is   imputed to the passenger because the passenger and the driver operated the vehicle as a common enterprise   or the passenger and the driver had a special relationship.            9      "      <h4><a name='121.96' href='121.96'>121.96</a></h4><p>NEGLIGENCE OF DRIVER IMPUTED TO PASSENGER—   AGENCY AND JOINT ENTERPRISE      If (name of driver) and (name of defendant) were each   negligent and the negligence of each caused the injury to the plaintiff, then   you must decide whether plaintiff is chargeable with the negligence of   (name of driver).      Plaintiff is chargeable with the negligence of (name of driver) if   you find:      (name of driver) was acting as the agent of plaintiff.      (name of driver) and plaintiff were operating the vehicle in a   joint enterprise.      Notes on Use      Either of the factors set forth in the instruction would be sufficient to impute negligence to the   plaintiff passenger. Follow this instruction with PIK 4" , Principal/Agent Relationship, and/or PIK   4" , Joint Enterprise Defined. Also give instruction to the effect that the burden of persuasion to   establish agency or joint enterprise is on the party so contending.      Comment      Authority for the instruction is set forth in Angell v. Hester, 186 Kan. 43, 348 P.2d 1050 (1960).      In order to impute the negligence of the driver to the passenger, the passenger must have exercised   control or the right to control the operation of the vehicle. Heiserman v. Aikman, 163 Kan. 700, 186 P.2d   252 (1947). The right to control by a principal is part of the definition of agency. (See PIK 4" .)   Equal right to control is included in the definition of joint enterprise. Hunter v. Brand, 186 Kan. 415, 350   P.2d 805 (1960). (See PIK 4" .)     The doctrine of imputed negligence is “a fiction of the law which finds small favor with the courts.”   Hunter v. Brand, 186 Kan. 415, 418, 350 P.2d 805 (1960).     In Scott v. McGaugh, 211 Kan. 323, 506 P.2d 1155 (1973), the court discussed the application of the   doctrine of joint enterprise for the vicarious liability of a passenger for the negligence of the driver and   held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff and his driver were   engaged in a joint venture.     See comment under PIK 4 , Joint Enterprise Defined, in regard to the issue of joint   enterprise.     This instruction is recognized as being in accord with the law in Jackson v. City of Kansas City, 235   Kan. 278, 9, 680 P.2d 877 (1984).     The doctrine of imputed negligence applies only to two special relationships, the master-servant   relationship and joint enterprise. Lightner v. Frank, 240 Kan. 21, 727 P.2d 430 (1986). See also Southard   v. Lira, 212 Kan. 763, 512 P.2d 409 (1973).      0 2014      "       <h4><a name='121.97' href='121.97'>121.97</a></h4><p>JOINT ENTERPRISE DEFINED      To constitute a joint enterprise between a passenger and driver there must   be a common purpose for which they jointly use and occupy the vehicle so as   to give each the equal privilege and right to control and manage its operation.   The meaning of the word “control” is not necessarily limited to participation   in the manual operation of the vehicle; it also includes any situation where   there is an understanding between the parties that the passenger has the right,   and is possessed of equal authority with the driver, to prescribe conditions of   use and operation of the vehicle.      Notes on Use      This instruction is to be used only where joint enterprise is an issue in a motor vehicle case. It should   follow PIK 4" , Negligence of Driver Imputed to Passenger—Agency and Joint Enterprise, which   indicates that the existence of a joint enterprise results in a situation where negligence of a driver may be   imputed to a passenger.      Comment      As authority for the instruction, see Hunter v. Brand, 186 Kan. 415, 350 P.2d 805 (1960), and Schmid   v. Eslick, 181 Kan. 997, 317 P.2d 459 (1957).      Ordinarily the issue of joint enterprise is a question of law that is determined at pretrial conference. In   Scott v. McGaugh, 211 Kan. 323, 506 P.2d 1155 (1973), the Supreme Court set forth the elements that must   be supported by the evidence before the relationship of the parties will give rise to the application of the   doctrine. The court held that there must be “(1) an agreement, (2) a common purpose, (3) a community of   interest and (4) an equal right to a voice, accompanied by an equal right of control over the instrumentality   (the automobile).” The court stressed that it would be a rare case where a trial court would be justified in   imposing vicarious liability upon the passenger as a matter of law in the absence of an express agreement   for mutual right of control.     This instruction and comment thereto is recognized as being in accord with the law in Jackson v. City   of Kansas City, 235 Kan. 278, 9, 680 P.2d 877 (1984).      2012 1                 "      A.

Notes on Use      For authority, see the Kansas Tort Claims Act (KTCA), K.S.A. 75-6101 et seg. A governmental   entity’s liability exposure is comparable to that of a private entity unless one of the exceptions to liability   is applicable under K.S.A. 75-6104. The burden of proof is upon the governmental entity to establish a   statutory exception to liability. The applicable parenthetical words should be selected.      Comment      The KTCA makes liability the rule and immunity the exception, and the burden is on the governmental   entity to establish its entitlement to any of the exceptions set forth in K.S.A. 75-6104. Hopkins v. State, 237   Kan. 601, 702 P.2d 311 (1985).     A claim based upon negligence is not precluded under the KTCA if none of the exceptions in K.S.A.   75-6104 are applicable. See K.S.A. 75-6103. However, just as in any other negligence action, to establish   liability a plaintiff must establish (1) duty, (2) breach of duty, (3) causation, and (4) damages. See Kirk v.   City of Shawnee, 27 Kan. App. 2d 946, 10 P.3d 27 (2000).     Whether a duty exists is a question of law. Under the “public duty doctrine” a governmental agency’s   duty to the public at large does not establish a basis for an individual to claim the agency owed a legal duty   to the individual personally. No duty exists unless it is established the agency owed a special duty to the   injured party. Kirk v. City of Shawnee, 27 Kan. App. 2d 946, 10 P.3d 27 (2000).     The duty to warn of an escape is a common-law duty independent from the general public duty to   provide police protection (see K.S.A. 75-6104[n]) and there is no immunity under the KTCA. Cansler v.   State, 234 Kan. 554, 572, 675 P.2d 57 (1984). See also Restatement Second of Torts § 319 (1965).     A police officer may be liable for the use of unreasonable or excessive force in the arrest of a suspect   or the treatment of a prisoner following arrest. Neither the officer nor his employer has immunity under the      2008      "      2020      KTCA for an intentional tort. Caplinger v. Carter, 9 Kan. App. 2d 287, 676 P.2d 1300, rev. denied 235 Kan.   1041 (1984).     The KTCA does not apply to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims. Cook v. City of Topeka, 232 Kan. 334, 654   P.2d 953 (1982).      The common-law duty of a city to keep its streets in reasonably safe condition survives the immunity   granted under K.S.A. 75-6104(1). See Draskowich v. City of Kansas City, 242 Kan. 734, 750 P.2d 411   (1988).     Under the recreational use exception of the KTCA, K.S.A. 75-6104(0), “open area” is not interpreted   as limited to outdoor areas. Jackson v. U.S.D. 259, 268 Kan. 319, 995 P.2d 844 (2000).     The exception for discretionary functions in K.S.A. 75-6104(e) did not immunize the Kansas Highway   Patrol in a retaliation action arising from the involuntary job relocation of a state trooper following his use   of the Civil Service Act's appeal procedure. Hill v. State, 310 Kan. 490, 448 P.3d 457 (2019). In Williams   v. C-U-Out Bail Bonds, LLC, 310 Kan. 775, 450 P.3d 330 (2019), the same exception did not provide   grounds for immunity for city police officers who chose to discontinue an investigation into forcible entry   of a residence by armed bail bondsmen.

K.S.A. 75-6104(1) provides that a governmental agency shall not be liable for damages resulting   from accumulation of ice due to natural weather conditions unless the condition is affirmatively caused   by the governmental agency. In Taylor v. Reno County, 242 Kan. 307, 747 P.2d 100 (1987), the court held   that the county was immune because the accumulation of ice upon the bridge was not due to affirmative   negligent acts of the county.     The Kansas Tort Claims Act will not protect a city from liability because the city’s common-law   duty to keep its streets reasonably safe is mandatory. The city has no right or discretion to avoid this duty.   Draskowich v. City of Kansas City, 242 Kan. 734, 750 P.2d 411 (1988).     In Draskowich, the court held that the exceptions contained in K.S.A. 75-6104 did not apply. The   ice on the highway was not the result of natural weather conditions, but developed only after the BPU   employees turned the water back on and allowed the street to be flooded. The city simply failed to take acts   reasonably necessary for the protection of travelers in the westbound lanes. Draskowich v.

Comment      Where a serious defect exists in that portion of a street known as the parking, at a place where   numerous pedestrians would regularly and customarily travel, the city, having knowledge of the defect, is   bound to anticipate such use and is obligated to use a higher than ordinary degree of care in making such   a place safe for pedestrian travel. See Dunn v. City of Emporia, 181 Kan. 334, 311 P.2d 296 (1957). Cases   are cited stating that a city is ordinarily not held to the same degree of care in maintaining parking as it is   held in maintaining sidewalks.

MEDICAL      <h4><a name='123.01' href='123.01'>123.01</a></h4><p>DUTY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER      A has a duty to use the learning and skill ordinarily used   by other members of that same field of medicine in the same or similar   communities and circumstances. In using this learning and skill, the     must also use ordinary care and diligence. A violation of this   duty is negligence.      [This instruction sets forth the duty (insert name of health   care provider) owed to (insert name of plaintiff) regarding the   following claim(s): (insert particular claim from plaintiff’s   contentions).|      Notes on Use      The name of the particular type of health care provider such as medical doctor, osteopathic physician,   dentist, chiropractor, or nurse should be substituted for the general term.     See PIK 4"  for the duty of a hospital;  for the duty of a medical specialist; and    regarding a health care provider’s duty of disclosure and consent.      See PIK 4"  on establishing the health care provider’s standard of care by expert testimony.      When it is agreed that the standard of medical procedure is universal, consideration should be given   to deleting reference to “similar communities” as it may be confusing to jurors who hear experts from other   states or areas testify. If the standard is universal, the jury should not be concerned with using geography   as a criterion for comparison of standard of practice.     This instruction should be used rather than PIK 4% , Duty of Medical Specialist, when the   health care provider is not a specialist. Some cases may involve multiple health care providers or multiple   claims subject to different duties of care. To avoid jury confusion, the Committee recommends the   bracketed portion of the instruction be given so that the jury can identify which claims are governed by this   instruction.      Comment      Proof of malpractice requires two evidentiary steps. It requires evidence as to the recognized   standards of the medical community in the particular kind of case, and a showing that the health care   provider in question negligently departed from the standard in treating the patient. Three elements must   be proven through expert testimony in order for the plaintiff to prevail in a medical malpractice case: (1)   that a duty was owed by the health care provider to the patient; (2) that the duty was breached; and (3) that   a causal connection existed between the breached duty and the injury sustained by the patient. Wozniak v.   Lipoff, 242 Kan. 583, 587, 750 P.2d 971 (1988).      The trial court should specify in the instructions those specific allegations of negligence concerning   which there is evidence. Natanson v. Kline, 186 Kan. 393, 399, 350 P.2d 1093 (1960), clarified 187 Kan.      2014      "      2014      186, 354 P.2d 670 (1960). In Foster v. Klaumann, 296 Kan. 295, 294 P.3d 223 (2013), the court held it   was not reversible error to give the general physician duty of care instruction (PIK 4" ) along with   the specialist duty of care instruction (PIK 4" ) in a medical malpractice action against a specialist.     Physician-patient relationship. The existence of the duty of care is dependent on the existence of a   physician-patient relationship. A doctor must take some action to treat a patient in order for the relationship   to be established. A physician who gives an informed opinion at the request of a treating physician does   not owe a duty to the patient because no physician-patient relationship has been created. /rvin v. Smith, 272   Kan. 112, 31 P.3d 934 (2001).     A physician-patient relationship is not established by the mere fact that a physician has agreed to be   on call for consultation. The physician must take some action to treat a patient to establish the relationship.   Seeber v. Ebeling, 36 Kan. App. 2d 501, 141 P.3d 1180 (2006).     Duty of Care. The relation of a health care provider to his or her patient is implied by law. That duty   is to possess and exercise that reasonable degree of learning and skill ordinarily possessed by members   of his or her profession and of the school of medicine in the community where he or she practices or in   similar communities at the time of the treatment in question. The health care provider also owes a duty to   exercise ordinary care and diligence in treating a patient. Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 211, 873 P.2d 175   (1994); Douglas v. Lombardino, 236 Kan. 471, 478, 693 P.2d 1138 (1985); Roberson v. Counselman, 235   Kan. 1006, 1010, 686 P.2d 149 (1984), modified by Delaney v.

However, a physician is not a guarantor of good results. Liability does not arise merely from bad   results, nor if bad results are due to some cause other than the treatment rendered. Wozniak v. Lipoff, 242   Kan. 583, 607, 750 P.2d 971 (1988); Johnston v. Elkins, 241 Kan. 407, 411, 736 P.2d 935 (1987); Durflinger   v. Artiles, 234 Kan. 484, 673 P.2d 86 (1983), overruled in part by Boulanger v. Pol, 258 Kan. 289, 900 P.2d   823 (1995); Goheen v. Graber, 181 Kan. 107, 112, 309 P.2d 636 (1957).     In Glassman v. Costello, 267 Kan. 509, 986 P.2d 1050 (1999), the Supreme Court held that it was   proper for the trial court to submit the nature and extent of the physician’s duty of direction to the jury. The   abrogation of vicarious liability of a physician for the acts and omissions of other health care professionals   covered by the Health Care Stabilization Fund (K.S.A. 40-3404) does not relieve a physician of the duty to   direct members of the surgical team that he heads.             A physician has the same duty of care to a patient who comes under his care due to injuries that were   sustained due to the patient’s own fault as he does to every other patient. The fault of a patient in bringing   about his injuries, necessitating his admission to the hospital, should not be compared with the physician’s   in failing to render proper treatment. Huffman v. Thomas, 26 Kan. App. 2d 685, 994 P.2d 1072 (1999).     In State v. Naramore, 25 Kan. App. 2d 302, 325, 965 P.2d 211, rev. denied 266 Kan. 1114 (1998),   PIK 3d  and  [now PIK 4"  and ] were cited with approval as an appropriate   definition of a doctor’s duty and standard of care.     In Nold v. Binyon, 272 Kan. 87, 31 P.3d 274 (2001), the Supreme Court held that as a matter of law,   a physician who has a doctor-patient relationship with a pregnant woman who intends to carry her fetus to   term also has a doctor-patient relationship with the fetus.     “Same or similar communities.” For a general discussion of the concept of “same or similar   communities,” see Yeats v. Harms, 193 Kan. 320, 333, 393 P.2d 982 (1964).      The concept retains validity in modern law. See, for example, Wozniak v. Lipoff, 242 Kan. 583, 750   P.2d 971 (1988). However, it appears to be eroding. A “strict locality rule” has been rejected in Kansas,   and the Supreme Court has stated that modern advances in travel, communication and publishing have   narrowed the differences between the standards of care in various types of communities. See Chandler v.   Neosho Memorial Hospital, 223 Kan. 1, 3-4, 574 P.2d 136 (1977); Avey v. St. Francis Hospital & School of   Nursing, 201 Kan. 687, 8, 442 P.2d 1013 (1968).                                   "      Choice of treatment. See PIK 4"  and accompanying comments.             Res ipsa loquitur. See PIK 4" -A and accompanying comments.     Abandonment. A physician has a right to withdraw from a case, but is under a duty to give the patient   notice and afford the patient an opportunity to procure the services of another physician. Abandonment of a   case without such notice and opportunity may subject a physician to liability. Dicke v. Graves, 9 Kan. App.   2d 1, 3, 668 P.2d 189 (1983); Collins v. Meeker, 198 Kan. 390, 402, 424 P.2d 488 (1967); Capps v. Valk,   189 Kan. 287, 290, 369 P.2d 238 (1962).     Statute of limitations. Under K.S.A. 60-513(c), a cause of action in medical malpractice does not   accrue until substantial injury results from the alleged act of malpractice or until the fact of injury becomes   reasonably ascertainable.             Where there is conflicting evidence as to when a cause of action for medical malpractice is deemed   to have accrued under K.S.A. 60-513(c), the matter becomes an issue for determination by the trier of   fact. Jones v. Neuroscience Assocs., Inc., 250 Kan. 477, 827 P.2d 51 (1992). Jones further holds that the   doctrines of “physician-patient relationship” or “continuous treatment” do not toll the statute of limitations.   However, evidence of continuous treatment is relevant on the issue of when it was reasonably ascertainable   to the plaintiff that an injury was permanent or substantial.      The phrase “reasonably ascertainable” means that when an injury is known to be substantial, a   plaintiff in a medical malpractice case has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation as to whether the   injury was caused by negligence. Kelly v. Barnett, 23 Kan. App. 2d 564, 932 P.2d 471, rev. denied 262 Kan.   961 (1997).     If a health care provider enters into an express contract with a patient, the statute of limitations set   forth in K.S.A. 60-511 or 60-512, which control contract actions, may apply. See Juhnke v. Hess, 211 Kan.   438, 440, 506 P.2d 1142 (1973), and Noel v. Proud, 189 Kan. 6, 11, 367 P.2d 61 (1961).      For a discussion on how to determine whether a medical malpractice action sounds in tort or contract,   see Malone v. University of Kansas Medical Center, 220 Kan. 371, 6, 552 P.2d 885 (1976).     Health care professions subject to medical malpractice actions. A variety of types of health care   providers besides physicians have been held to be liable in medical malpractice actions.             The rules governing the duties and liability of dentists correspond to the rules of law applicable to   physicians. Simpson v. Davis, 219 Kan. 584, 549 P.2d 950 (1976); Dicke v. Graves, 9 Kan.

Psychiatrists are likewise subject to the same duties and liability as physicians. Durflinger v. Artiles,   234 Kan. 484, 673 P.2d 86 (1983), overruled in part by Boulanger v. Pol, 258 Kan. 289, 900 P.2d 823   (1995).      2014      "      2014      <h4><a name='123.02' href='123.02'>123.02</a></h4><p>DUTY OF HOSPITAL—STANDARD OF CARE      A hospital’s duty to a patient is to use the degree of reasonable care   required by that patient’s known physical and mental condition. On medical   or scientific matters, a hospital’s standard of reasonable care is the same care,   skill, and diligence used by hospitals in the same or similar communities and   circumstances. A violation of this duty is negligence.      Notes on Use      If the plaintiff s case is submitted to the jury on the common knowledge exception, PIK 4" -A,   Expert Testimony Not Required, should be given.     A version of PIK 4" , Health Care Provider’s Standard of Care—Expert’s Testimony, modified   to apply to hospitals, should also be given.      Comment      A hospital owes its patients a duty to exercise reasonable care, which is defined as such care, skill   and diligence as the known physical and mental condition of the patient may require, and it is that degree   of care used by other hospitals in the community or similar communities under like circumstances. Malone   v. University of Kansas Medical Center, 220 Kan. 371, 375, 552 P.2d 885 (1976); Hiatt v. Groce, 215 Kan.   14, 18, 523 P.2d 320 (1974); Avey v. St. Francis Hospital & School of Nursing, 201 Kan. 687, 8, 442   P.2d 1013 (1968).      Though the standard of care required of a particular hospital is to be determined based upon the   degree of care, skill and diligence used by hospitals in the community or in similar communities, the   Supreme Court has rejected the “strict locality rule.” The court has held that “locality” has more to do   with population, location, hospital and laboratory facilities and the medical practitioners and specialists   available than with geography, as advances in travel, communication and publication have reduced the gap   between rural and urban practitioners in the past century. Chandler v. Neosho Memorial Hospital, 223 Kan.   1, 3-5, 574 P.2d 136 (1977); Avey v. St. Francis Hospital & School of Nursing, 201 Kan. 687, 8, 442   P.2d 1013 (1968). The standard of hospital care that is to be applied in any given case is not a rule of law,   but is a matter to be established by the testimony of competent medical experts. Nold v. Binyon, 272 Kan.   87, 31 P.3d 274 (2001).     Ordinarily, expert testimony is required to establish negligence on the part of a hospital. An exception   to this rule is recognized when the medical procedures are so patently bad that negligence or lack of skill is   manifest to a lay observer, or other acts complained of could be regarded as negligent by applying common   knowledge and experience. Hiatt v. Groce, 215 Kan. 14, 19, 523 P.2d 320 (1974).      The common knowledge exception has been successfully used by plaintiffs in a number of Kansas   cases, including the following: McKnight v. St. Francis Hosp. and School of Nursing, 224 Kan. 632, 585   P.2d 984 (1978) (fall from an x-ray table); Karrigan v. Nazareth Convent and Academy, Inc., 212 Kan. 44,   510 P.2d 190 (1973) (failure to call doctor for patient in severe pain); and McCoy v.

"      It has been held inapplicable in a number of cases, including St. Francis Regional Med. Center, Inc.   v. Hale, 12 Kan. App. 2d 614, 752 P.2d 129 (1988) (staph infection); and Crooks v. Greene, 12 Kan. App.   2d 62, 736 P.2d 78 (1987) (prescription for Valium).     A hospital is not liable because of the rendering of or failure to render professional services within the   hospital by a physician who is licensed to practice medicine and covered under the Health Care Stabilization   Fund, if the physician is not an employee or agent of the hospital. McVay v. Rich, 18 Kan. App. 2d 746, 859   P.2d 399 (1993) aff'd 255 Kan. 371, 874 P.2d 641 (1994).     A similar standard of care is applicable to nursing homes. Juhnke v. Evangelical Lutheran Good   Samaritan Society, 6 Kan. App. 2d 744, 634 P.2d 1132 (1981); Mellies v. National Heritage, Inc., 6 Kan.   App. 2d 910, 636 P.2d 215 (1981).     An instruction similar to PIK 4  was approved as an accurate statement of a nursing home’s   standard of care in Hoover v. Innovative Health of Kansas, Inc., 26 Kan. App. 2d 447, 988 P.2d 287   (1999).     In a nursing home negligence case, the Adult Care Home Licensure Act, K.S.A. 39-323 et seq., and   related regulations, K.A.R. 28-39-138 et seq., do not provide an applicable standard of care to be given   to the jury in lieu of expert testimony, and do not create a private cause of action.

Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 65-2891. Specify the licensed person as the health care provider, as defined   in section K.S.A. 65-289 1(e).     The intent of the statute is to provide a protection to health care providers who give emergency care.   Subsections A and B, which correspond to subsections (a) and (b) of the statute, apply to on-the-scene aid.   [See subsection (d) of the statute for authority for this statement.] A health care provider who renders on-   the-scene assistance is liable only for gross negligence or willful or wanton acts or omissions.                 "      Subsection C, which corresponds to subsection (c) of the statute, abolishes the ordinary requirement   that a health care provider obtain the informed consent of the patient before rendering professional care and   treatment, when an emergency exists.     K.S.A. 65-2891(d) provides that if the emergency care or assistance is performed in the physician’s   or dentist’s office, clinic, emergency room or hospital, with or without compensation, the ordinary standards   of care and rules of negligence apply, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the   statute.     K.S.A. 65-2891(b), which allows the health care provider to render good faith emergency treatment   without first obtaining the consent of the parent or guardian, apparently is intended to dispense with the   requirement of informed consent where a minor is the patient. See Younts v. St. Francis Hospital & School   of Nursing, 205 Kan. 292, 469 P.2d 330 (1970). See PIK 4"  for Informed Consent.     The terms “gross negligence” and “wanton conduct” are synonymous. See PIK 4" . For   “willful” conduct, see PIK 4° . The term “emergency” would include the need for prompt or   immediate action for care or treatment. In an appropriate case the judge may have to define a “competitive   sport.”      Comment      The appellate courts have not yet considered the constitutionality of K.S.A. 65-2891.

Lungstrum, 223 Kan. 487, 490, 575 P.2d 22 (1978); Crowley v. O’Neil, 4 Kan. App. 2d 491, 5, 609   P.2d 198 (1980).     The standard of medical care that is to be applied in any given case is not a rule of law, but a matter   to be established by the testimony of competent medical experts. Nold v. Binyon, 272 Kan. 87, 31 P.3d 274   (2001).     Learned treatises, found to be relevant and admitted only after the predicate testimony required by   K.S.A. 60-460(cc), were held to have been properly admitted to establish a physician’s standard of care in   Wilson v. Knight, 26 Kan. App. 2d 226, 982 P.2d 400 (1999).     “Common knowledge” exception. Experts are not needed to establish the appropriate standards of   care when either the doctrine of common knowledge or the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies. Hubbard   v. Mellion, 48 Kan App. 2d 1005, 1, 302 P.3d 1084, rev. denied 298 Kan. 1202 (2013). See PIK 4"   -A and accompanying comments.                        "      Community standard. The fact that the expert witness has not practiced in the same community as   the defendant does not disqualify him or her as an expert, so long as it appears that the expert is familiar   with the degree of care and skill used by health care providers in that community. Chandler v. Neosho   Memorial Hospital, 223 Kan. 1, 3-4, 574 P.2d 136 (1977); Barnes v. St. Francis Hospital & School of   Nursing, 211 Kan. 315, 319, 507 P.2d 288 (1973); Avey v. St. Francis Hospital & School of Nursing, 201   Kan. 687, 3, 442 P.2d 1013 (1968).     Qualification of Expert Witness. The admissibility of expert testimony in any medical malpractice   liability action is governed by K.S.A. 60-3412. In Tompkins v. Bise, 259 Kan. 39, 910 P.2d 185 (1996),   reversing Tompkins v. Bise, 20 Kan. App. 2d 837, 893 P.2d 262 (1995), the Kansas Supreme Court held   that K.S.A. 60-3412 does not require that an expert witness in a medical malpractice action be licensed by   the same professional board as the defendant. The definition of “profession” must be related to whether   the expert is qualified to perform the procedure at issue and is not limited to the particular licensure of the   defendant health care provider.     In Glassman v. Costello, 267 Kan. 509, 986 P.2d 1050 (1999), it was held that K.S.A. 60-3412 was   not intended to require that only a physician practicing in a particular specialized area could qualify as an   expert witness as to the applicable standard of care of a physician practicing in the same specialized area.   For example, in Wisker v. Hart, 244 Kan. 36, 766 P.2d 168 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the statute   does not preclude a surgeon from testifying as to the standard of care applicable to a general practitioner and   a general practitioner from testifying as to the standard of care applicable to a surgeon. The opinion further   held that the weight to be afforded to testimony of physicians testifying outside their area of specialization   is a matter to be determined by the jury.                    To qualify as a standard of care expert, K.S.A. 60-3412 requires that the expert must devote at least   50% of such person’s professional time in the two years preceding the incident to “actual clinical practice.”   The Court of Appeals addressed this requirement in Endorf v. Bohlender, 26 Kan. App. 2d 855, 995 P.2d   896 (2000), and held that the phrase “actual clinical practice” means patient care. However, patient care is   not limited to a physical presence or bedside requirement and would include, for example, a practitioner of   healing arts who offers advice or addresses the care of a distant patient through electronic media.     In determining whether an expert witness is statutorily qualified to testify to the standard of care,   the court should examine the two years preceding the incident to determine if during that time, when   considered as a whole, the expert devoted more than 50 percent of the expert’s professional time to actual   clinical practice. Williams v. Lawton, 288 Kan. 768, 207 P.3d 1027 (2009).     In Nold v. Binyon, 272 Kan. 87, 31 P.3d 274 (2001), the Supreme Court held that a physician with   extensive experience in gynecology and obstetrics was qualified to testify as to the standards applicable to   nurses working in hospital labor and delivery units.     Scope of expert testimony. During direct examination, experts should confine their opinions to   relevant matters that are certain or probable. The expert must give his or her opinion within a reasonable   medical probability. “Expressions such as ‘probably’ and ‘more likely than not’ and others of similar import   are proper qualifications for a medical expert’s opinion testimony if, taken as a whole, the testimony reflects   an honest expression of professional opinion as to reasonable medical probabilities.” Pope v. Ransdell, 251   Kan. 112, 122, 833 P.2d 965 (1992); Sharples v. Roberts, 249 Kan. 286, 296, 816 P.2d 390 (1991).     The expert need not pinpoint the exact procedure that caused the injury in order to give his or   her opinion that a clear deviation from the appropriate standard of care occurred or that the health care   provider’s actions proximately caused the injury. Smith v. Milfeld, 19 Kan. App. 2d 252, 256, 869 P.2d 748   (1993).     Experts should confine their opinions to matters which are certain or probable and should not testify   to matters that are mere possibilities. Bacon v. Mercy Hosp. of Ft. Scott, 243 Kan. 303, 8, 756 P.2d   416 (1988).              2014      "      <h4><a name='123.11' href='123.11'>123.11</a></h4><p>PHYSICIAN’S SELECTION OF COURSE OF TREATMENT      Comment      No separate instruction concerning a physician’s selection of treatment is recommended. The   Committee believes the applicable standard of care instruction is sufficient to properly instruct the jury when   there is a dispute over the course of treatment selected by the physician. The selection among alternative   courses of treatment, like other aspects of medical care provided by a physician, must be consistent with   the applicable standard of care.     The language of the former version of this instruction stating that a physician had a “right” to   exercise his or her best judgment when picking a course of treatment was criticized by the court in Foster   v. Klaumann, 296 Kan. 295, 294 P.3d 223 (2013). See also Lee v. Fisher, 41 Kan.

To avoid jury confusion, the Committee recommends the bracketed portion of   the instruction be given so that the jury can identify which claims are governed by this instruction.      Comment      The duty of a physician to exercise reasonable and ordinary care and diligence remains the same   regardless of the particular medical specialty in which a health care provider practices. However, particular   decisions and acts of the physician will vary with the circumstances of the patient’s condition and the   medical specialty of the physician. Roberson v. Counselman, 235 Kan. 1006, 1010, 686 P.2d 149 (1984),   modified by Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 873 P.2d 175 (1994); Durflinger v.

In Foster v. Klaumann, 296 Kan. 295, 294 P.3d 223 (2013), the Supreme Court held that it was   not reversible error for the trial court to give both PIK 4"  and PIK 4" , even though it   was uncontroverted that the defendant was a specialist. The court held that the two instructions were not   necessarily inconsistent.     A physician who makes a referral to another physician is not liable for the other’s malpractice,   absent negligence in the selection of the other physician or specialist, if there is no agency or concert of   action. Stovall v. Harms, 214 Kan. 835, 840, 522 P.2d 353 (1974).     A physician who is not a specialist, and yet proceeds with diagnosis, care, and treatment in a   specialist’s field is held to the standard of care of the specialty with which he or she is dealing.

Kline, 186 Kan. 393,   2, 350 P.2d 1093, clarified 187 Kan. 186, 354 P.2d 670 (1960).     However, in Bartal v. Brower, 268 Kan. 195, 993 P.2d 629 (1999), it was held that a physician who   associated with another surgeon to do a portion of a surgical procedure had the duty of informing the   parents of a minor about all of the possible consequences of the surgery, including those portions of the   surgery to be performed by the associated specialist, or to make sure that the specialist met with the parents   and obtained their informed consent for the part of the surgery that he intended to perform.       2010      "       <h4><a name='123.14' href='123.14'>123.14</a></h4><p>DISCLOSURE AND CONSENT—DUTY OF   HEALTH CARE PROVIDER      A has a duty to make a reasonable disclosure to the patient of   the nature and probable consequences of the suggested or recommended   treatment including the dangers within (his) (her) knowledge which are   possible in the treatment proposed. This disclosure is required so the patient   can make an intelligent informed consent to the proposed treatment. The   duty of the to disclose is limited to those disclosures which a   would reasonably make under the same or similar circumstances.      If a complete disclosure of all facts, diagnoses and possible consequences   would endanger the recovery of the patient because of an existing physical or   mental condition, the may withhold such information.      Notes on Use      This instruction covers the duty of a physician, dentist, anesthesiologist or other specialist to disclose   fully those facts necessary for the patient to make an informed consent to a proposed course of treatment.   The type of health care provider whose conduct is at issue should be inserted in the blanks.      Comment      The above instruction is based upon the doctrine of “informed consent” as established in Natanson   v. Kline, 186 Kan. 393, 350 P.2d 1093, clarified 187 Kan. 186, 354 P.2d 670 (1960).      Funke v. Fieldman, 212 Kan. 524, 512 P.2d 539 (1973), contains a comprehensive review of the law   relating to informed consent. The case deals with a physician’s duty to make a reasonable disclosure to   his or her patient of the dangers within the physician’s knowledge which are incident to or possible in the   proposed treatment. The case also discussed the plaintiff s burden to prove a causal connection between the   lack of disclosure and the injury that plaintiff eventually suffered.      Other cases discussing the doctrine include: Wozniak v. Lipoff,; 242 Kan. 583, 8, 750 P.2d   971 (1988); Lindquist v. Ayerst Laboratories, Inc., 227 Kan. 308, 318, 607 P.2d 1339 (1980); Charley v.   Cameron, 215 Kan. 750, 7, 528 P.2d 1205 (1974); Stovall v. Harms, 214 Kan. 835, 842, 522 P.2d   353 (1974); and Tatro v. Lueken, 212 Kan. 606, 512 P.2d 529 (1973).      In Wecker v. Amend, 22 Kan. App. 2d 498, 918 P.2d 658 (1996), it was held that the doctrine of   informed consent requires a physician to make a reasonable disclosure to a patient of medically acceptable   alternative treatments, including the option of no treatment, when there was evidence that choosing no   treatment at all was a viable medical option. The court held that it was prejudicial error not to modify   PIK 2d 15.16 [antecedent of PIK 4 ] to include the duty to disclose to the patient the option of no   treatment.     Whether or not a physician has informed his patient of the inherent risks and hazards of a proposed   form of treatment is question of fact concerning which lay witnesses are competent to testify. The   establishment of the fact is not dependent upon expert medical testimony. Natanson v. Kline, 187 Kan. 186,   190, 354 P.2d 670 (1960).     Where disclosure of the inherent risks and hazards have been made to the patient, however, and the   question is whether the physician’s disclosure is sufficient to accord with disclosures made by reasonable      2008                   medical practitioners under the same or similar circumstances, expert medical testimony will be required.   Charley v. Cameron, 215 Kan. 750, 757, 528 P.2d 1205 (1974).      Although a physician may not minimize the known risks of a procedure in order to induce a patient’s   consent, the physician is not obligated to inform the patient of every infinitesimal, imaginative or speculative   risk. Funke v. Fieldman, 212 Kan. 524, 535, 512 P.2d 539 (1973); Collins v. Meeker, 198 Kan. 390, 397,   424 P.2d 488 (1967).      The plaintiff must establish a causal connection between the physician’s failure to properly disclose   risks and the harm suffered. In order to establish the causal connection it must be shown a) that the   unrevealed risk that should have been made known actually materialized, and b) that disclosure of the risk   to the patient would have resulted in a decision against undergoing the treatment. Savina v. Sterling Drug,   Inc., 247 Kan. 105, 132, 795 P.2d 915 (1990); Funke v. Fieldman, 212 Kan. 524, 535, 536, 512 P.2d 539   (1973).     A general practitioner referring a patient to a psychiatric specialist has been held to have no duty to   inform the patient of the risks and dangers incident to psychiatric treatment. Stovall v. Harms, 214 Kan.   835, 843, 522 P.2d 353 (1974).     However, in Bartal v.

As to disclosure   requirements concerning other types of treatment, see PIK 4" . The bracketed paragraphs of the   instruction should be included when applicable to the evidence. If you find consent is an issue, PIK 4%    should be given.      Comment      The law regarding consent to surgical operations is reviewed in Younts v. St. Francis Hospital &   School of Nursing, 205 Kan. 292, 469 P.2d 330 (1970). In the absence of an emergency or unanticipated   conditions arising during surgery, a surgeon must obtain the consent of the patient before operating. A   surgical procedure performed without the consent of the patient or some authorized person is a technical   battery or trespass regardless of the result. To be sufficient, the consent of the patient must be given with      2008                   "      a reasonable knowledge of the nature of the surgery and some understanding of the risks involved and the   possible anticipated results. The opinion also provides that when the patient fully appreciates the dangers   involved, the failure to make a full disclosure to the patient has no causal relation to the injury. In such   event, the consent of the patient to the proposed treatment is an informed consent.     Younts further notes that generally the consent of the parent to a surgical operation on a child is   necessary. An exception to this rule is recognized when the child is close to maturity and knowingly gives   an informed consent. 205 Kan. at 301.      Consent to the performance of an operation may be granted by conduct. Charley v. Cameron, 215   Kan. 750, 755, 528 P.2d 1205 (1974).      In Bartal v.

A health care provider has the right to expect a patient to follow   reasonable advice. The failure of a patient to accept reasonable treatment   or follow reasonable advice does not relieve the health care provider from   the results of earlier malpractice. It only absolves him from liability for any   increased injury caused by the patient’s failure to accept reasonable treatment   and advice.      In this case you must decide whether the patient failed to accept reasonable   treatment and advice. If you so find, then you must decide whether that failure   should be considered as failure to mitigate damages, or, in the alternative, as   fault. If you determine conduct to be fault, it cannot also be considered as a   failure to mitigate. Conversely, if you determine conduct to establish a failure   to mitigate, it cannot also be considered as fault.      Notes on Use      In many cases, the line between mitigation and fault will be blurred, and in those cases, the decision   of whether failure to follow medical advice is comparative fault or failure to mitigate damages must be   submitted to the jury.      Comment      In Parr v. Young, 121 Kan. 47, 50, 246 P. 181 (1926), the Supreme Court recognized a patient’s duty   to follow the reasonable directions and advice of his or her physician.     In Wisker v. Hart, 244 Kan. 36, 766 P.2d 168 (1988), the Supreme Court approved the giving of a   comparative fault instruction in a situation in which the patient’s failure to heed his doctor’s advice played   a major role in the event which brought about his death.     In Maunz v. Perales, 276 Kan. 313, 76 P.3d 1027 (2003), the Supreme Court held the jury was   properly allowed to evaluate the comparative fault of a mentally disturbed patient who committed suicide.   The court held that the comparison should be made under a capacity-based standard.     In Cox v. Lesko, 23 Kan. App. 2d 794, 935 P.2d 1086 (1997), the Court of Appeals held that failure to   follow medical advice which occurred subsequent to the alleged malpractice constituted failure to mitigate   damages, not comparative fault. The Supreme Court reviewed and reversed that holding in its decision, Cox   v. Lesko, 263 Kan. 805, 953 P.2d 1033 (1998). The court held that the distinction between comparative fault   and failure to mitigate damages is a fact question which should be decided by the jury.     The Committee believes that the practical effect of the distinction between comparative fault and   failure to mitigate damages is that the prohibition against awarding damages to a plaintiff who bears 50%   or more of the fault would not appear to apply to failure to mitigate damages.                              "      In Huffman v. Thomas, 26 Kan. App. 2d 685, 994 P.2d 1072 (1999), the Court of Appeals held that   the effect of Wisker v. Hart, supra, and Cox v. Lesko, supra, would be limited to those cases in which a   patient failed to follow a doctor’s instructions. The court refused to extend the concepts embodied by those   decisions to allow comparison of the fault of plaintiff s decedent in bringing about the injuries for which   he was being treated.      2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='123.21' href='123.21'>123.21</a></h4><p>LOSS OF CHANCE—SURVIVAL—CAUSATION      The plaintiff has claimed that (he) (she) was denied a substantial chance   of survival due to the fault of the defendant.

In making the determination, the finder of fact should take into account   both the patient’s chances if properly treated and the extent to which the patient’s chances of survival have   been reduced by the claimed negligence.” Roberson v. Counselman, 235 Kan. 1006, 1020, 686 P.2d 149   (1984), modified by Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 873 P.2d 175 (1994). Thus, the Kansas Supreme Court   recognized a cause of action for a loss of less than an even chance of survival.     The language in Roberson, which refers to the loss of “an appreciable chance to survive,” was   disapproved of by the court in Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 215, 873 P.2d 175 (1994). The court stated   that the “more appropriate language would contemplate a substantial chance to survive.” The remainder of   the Roberson opinion was found to be sound.     “Where the jury finds a patient would have had a greater than 50 percent chance of surviving had he      received proper medical treatment, traditional negligence rules apply, not the loss of chance rule.” Donnini   v. Ouano, 15 Kan. App. 2d 517, Syl. 1 4, 810 P.2d 1163 (1991).                              "      Computing damages in a loss of chance of surviving for a term of years (rather than life) was resolved   in Boody v. U.S., 706 F. Supp. 1458 (D. Kan. 1989), where the court held plaintiff's damages should be   calculated by multiplying the total value of the decedent’s life by the percentage of life lost due to the   physician defendant’s negligence.     In Dickey v. Daughety, 21 Kan. App. 2d 655, 905 P.2d 697 (1995), aff'd 260 Kan. 12, 917 P.2d 889   (1996), it was held that the court should apply the percentage of the lost chance award to the damage award   before applying the cap on non-pecuniary awards mandated by K.S.A. 60-1903.     In Pipe v. Hamilton, 274 Kan. 905, Syl. 1 4, 56 P.3d 823 (2002), the Supreme Court reversed the   trial court’s decision granting summary judgment to a physician who unsuccessfully treated a patient who   had only a 5% to 10% chance of survival if treated properly. The court cited with approval the definition of   “substantial chance for survival/better recovery” found in PIK 3d  and  [now PIK 4"    and ], and held, as a matter of law, that a 10% chance of survival is not “token or de minimis.” The   court ruled that the plaintiff's claim must be submitted to a jury.      2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='123.22' href='123.22'>123.22</a></h4><p>LOSS OF CHANCE—BETTER RECOVERY—CAUSATION      The plaintiff has claimed that (he) (she) was denied a substantial chance   for better recovery due to the fault of the defendant. Before you can find the   defendant to be at fault, you must find:      1. That would have had a substantial chance for better recovery   if the had been (diagnosed) (treated) in a timely manner and under   the applicable standard of care;      2. That the defendant failed to (diagnose) (treat) (in a timely   manner) (under the applicable standard of care); and      3. That the resulting injury or lessened degree of recovery suffered by   as a result of defendant’s failure was substantial.      As used in this instruction, a “substantial chance for better recovery” is   one which is capable of being estimated, weighed, judged, or recognized by a   reasonable mind.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be used when the action is based upon diminution or deprivation of chance   for better recovery. See also PIK 4" , Verdict Form—Loss of Chance Issue—Better Recovery.      Comment      In addition to recognizing loss of chance to survive causes of action, the Kansas Supreme Court   stated the loss of chance theory in medical malpractice cases also applies to a loss of a substantial chance   for better recovery. Loss of better recovery causes of action arise when a “patient survives a preexisting   injury or illness but fails to make the extent or quality of recovery that might have resulted absent the   alleged medical malpractice.” Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 202, 873 P.2d 175 (1994).     The “diminished recovery obtained as a result of malpractice must be one of substance and not   merely a minor result that might possibly have been somewhat better absent the malpractice.” Delaney v.   Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 216, 873 P.2d 175 (1994).     In Dickey v. Daughety, 21 Kan. App. 2d 655, 905 P.2d 697 (1995), aff'd 260 Kan. 12, 917 P.2d 889   (1996), it was held that the court should apply the percentage of the lost chance award to the damage award   before applying the cap on non-pecuniary awards mandated by K.S.A. 60-1903.     In Pipe v.

LEGAL      <h4><a name='123.40' href='123.40'>123.40</a></h4><p>DUTY OF LAWYER      A lawyer’s duty to a client is to use the learning, skill and care that a   reasonably competent lawyer would use in similar circumstances. In using   this learning, skill and care, the lawyer must also use ordinary care and   diligence. A violation of this duty is negligence.      Notes on Use      For authority, see Bowman v. Doherty, 235 Kan. 870, 878, 686 P.2d 112 (1984), Restatement (Second)   of Torts § 299A, and cases cited in 7 Am. Jur. 2d, Attorneys at Law § 199. See also Prosser and Keeton on   the Law of Torts (Sth ed.) pp 6 § 32, and Attorney Malpractice: Law and Procedure §§ 2.1-2.12.      If liability is based on negligence, this instruction should be given. Liability may also arise from   breach of a fiduciary duty or breach of contract. In those events, the reader is referred to Chapter ,   Fiduciary Relationships or Chapter , Contracts.      Comment      When both elements of contract and tort are present it must be determined, before this instruction   is used, whether: (1) the gravamen of the action is the breach of a duty imposed by law upon the attorney-   client relationship and not on the contract; or (2) the gist of the action constitutes a breach of a specific term   of the contract without reference to legal duties imposed by law upon the relationship. If the facts support   the first reference, the action would be in tort and the instruction on negligence would be applicable. If the   evidence justifies the second, the action would be in contract and this instruction would be inapplicable.   However, when the evidence supports both theories, the issues could be submitted to the jury on both   theories as alternative theories of recovery. See Hunt v. KMG Main Hurdman, 17 Kan. App. 2d 418, 839   P.2d 45 (1992), and Pizel v. Zuspann, 247 Kan. 54, 72-73, 795 P.2d 42 (1990).     In order to prevail on a claim of legal malpractice, a plaintiff is required to show (1) the duty of the   attorney to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) a causal connection between   the breach of duty and the resulting injury, and (4) actual loss or damage. Additionally, to prove legal   malpractice in the handling of litigation, a plaintiff must establish the validity of the underlying claim by   showing that it would have resulted in a favorable judgment in the underlying lawsuit had it not been for   the attorney’s error. Canaan v. Bartee, 276 Kan. 116, 72 P.3d 911 (2003), cert. denied 540 U.S. 1090, 124   S. Ct. 962, 157 L. Ed. 2d 795 (2003). Canaan further provides that a person convicted in a criminal action   must first obtain post conviction relief before maintaining an action alleging malpractice against his or her   former criminal defense attorneys.     “... [I]na legal malpractice action, a plaintiff must show that his attorney failed to use that degree of   learning, skill, and care that a reasonably competent lawyer would use in similar circumstances.” Canaan,   276 Kan. at 129.      In Kansas, the relationship of an attorney to his or her client is fiduciary in character, binding   the attorney to the highest degree of fidelity and good faith to his or her client on account of the trust                              "      and confidence imposed. Ford v. Guarantee Abstract & Title Co., 220 Kan. 244, 261, 553 P.2d 254   (1976); Alexander v. Russo, 1 Kan. App. 2d 546, 571 P.2d 350 (1977). See Chapter , Fiduciary   Relationships.     The relationship of attorney-client can only be created by a contract of employment, express or   implied. Young v. Hecht, 3 Kan. App. 2d 510, 597 P.2d 682 (1979). But see Pizel v. Zuspann, 247 Kan. 54,   795 P.2d 42, mod and reh. denied 247 Kan. 699, 803 P.2d 205 (1990), appeal after remand 252 Kan. 384,   845 P.2d 37 (1993), regarding liability to parties not in privity and the balancing test used by the court to   determine when a nonclient may recover. The balancing test contains six criteria for consideration: (1)   the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff; (2) the foreseeability of harm to the   plaintiff; (3) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (4) the closeness of the connection   between the attorney’s conduct and the injury; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; and (6) the burden   on the profession of the recognition of liability under the circumstances.     Pizel additionally holds that comparative fault principles apply to legal malpractice actions based   upon negligence unless as a matter of law the client had no obligation to act on his or her own behalf. Also   see Pizel v. Whalen, 252 Kan. 384, 845 P.2d 37 (1993). Following Pizel v. Zuspann, the court in Wilson-   Cunningham v. Meyer, 16 Kan. App. 2d 197, 820 P.2d 725 (1991), found that children had no cause of   action in tort for loss of parent’s property against an attorney who had acted as that parent’s attorney in a   divorce action.     In Bank IV Wichita v. Arn, Mullins, Unruh, Kuhn & Wilson, 250 Kan. 490, 827 P.2d 758 (1992),   following the rationale of Pizel v. Zuspann, 247 Kan. 54, 795 P.2d 42 (1990), it was held that a nonclient   third-party may have a cause of action against a borrower’s lawyer if the lawyer gave advice to the lender   or expected his advice to be relied upon by the lender.     An attorney is not liable for professional negligence to his client’s adversary; the remedy for an   adversary third-party action is an action for malicious prosecution. Nelson v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607 P.2d   438 (1980).     In Johnson v. Wiegers, 30 Kan. App. 2d 672, 46 P.3d 563 (2002), the Court of Appeals held that a   three step analysis is required to determine whether an attorney owes a duty to a third-party nonclient. First,   if the client of the attorney and the third party are adversaries, no duty arises under Nelson. Second, if the   attorney and client never intended for the work to benefit the third party, no duty arises under Bank IV.   Third, if the attorney and client arguably intended for the attorney’s work to benefit the third party, then the   Pizel balancing test must be applied to determine if a duty was owed.      A cause of action for legal malpractice accrues as soon as the right to maintain a legal action arises.   See Dearborn Animal Clinic, P.A. v. Wilson, 248 Kan. 257, 806 P.2d 997 (1991); Knight v. Myers, 12 Kan.   App. 2d 469, 474, 748 P.2d 896 (1988); and Pancake House, Inc. v. Redmond, 239 Kan. 83, 716 P.2d 575   (1986). In Pancake House, the Kansas Supreme Court reviewed the four theories that could be applied   in Kansas as to the accrual of a cause of action for legal malpractice under K.S.A. 60-513(a)(4) and the   application of the applicable statute of limitation under K.S.A. 60-513(b). The court stated:   “Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case, there are at least four   theories which can apply to attorney malpractice in Kansas as to when the accrual of a   cause of action occurs and the statute of limitations begins to run. These include:   (1) The occurrence rule—the statute begins to run at the occurrence of the   lawyer’s negligent act or omission.   (2) The damage rule—the client does not accrue a cause of action for   malpractice until he suffers appreciable harm or actual damage as a   consequence of his lawyer’s conduct.   (3) The discovery rule—the statute does not begin to run until the client   discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the material facts essential   to his cause of action against the attorney.      2020      "      2014      (4) The continuous representation rule—the client’s cause of action does not   accrue until the attorney-client relationship is terminated.” Pancake House,   239 Kan. at 87.     In Dearborn Animal Clinic, PA. v. Wilson, 248 Kan. 257, 264, 806 P.2d 997 (1991), the Supreme   Court discussed the attempt of other states to limit the rule to one theory but stated that: “ ... practice   demonstrates that no matter how desirable it might be to have one black-letter rule that applied in every   case, justice and fairness, as well as the statute [K.S.A. 60-513(b)], preclude the adoption of one theory to   the exclusion of all others.”     In KPERS v. Kutak Rock, 273 Kan. 481, 44 P.3d 407 (2002), the Supreme Court examined an   attorney’s duty to steer a client away from bad investment decisions. The court held that “an attorney has a   duty to do that which he or she is hired to do by a trust or non-trust client.” /d. at 493. The court further held   the services to be performed by the defendant law firm were specifically stated in the engagement letter and   did not give rise to a duty to render advice regarding the financial wisdom of the investment. /d. at 492. In   the absence of specific direction from the client, “[t]he scope of the attorney’s duty in the circumstances of   this case is commensurate with his or her undertaking.” /d. at 495.      In Bergstrom v. Noah, 266 Kan. 847, 974 P.2d 531 (1999), the Supreme Court recognized an “error   of judgment defense” to a legal malpractice action. The court emphasized that the exception was a narrow   one and could not be used where the issue is settled and can be identified through ordinary research and   investigative techniques. However, where the law is unclear, or has not been settled by the appellate courts,   or involves new occurrences not yet considered by the courts or the legislature, an attorney is not liable for   a mere error in judgment if he or she has acted in good faith and in an honest belief that his or her acts are   well founded and in the best interest of the client.

Notes on Use      For authority, see Dings v. Callahan, 4 Kan. App. 2d 36, 602 P.2d 542 (1979) and Webb v. Pomeroy,   8 Kan. App. 2d 246, 655 P.2d 465 (1982), rev. denied 232 Kan. 876 (1983). Select the appropriate bracketed   phrase and also instruct as to the prior lawsuit.      The fact-finder must make its determination about the outcome of the underlying lawsuit solely on   the evidence related to that claim. The Court of Appeals also suggested bifurcation of the two parts of the   legal malpractice case would ensure a clean demarcation between the two during trial. Power Control   Devices, Inc. v. Lerner, 56 Kan. App. 2d 690, Syl. 1 4, 437 P.3d 66, rev. denied 310 Kan. 1063 (2019).      Comment      In order for a party to prove legal malpractice in the handling of litigation, it is necessary for the   plaintiff in the malpractice case to successfully retry the underlying lawsuit. Webb v. Pomeroy, 8 Kan. App.   2d 246, 655 P.2d 465 (1982), reh. denied 232 Kan. 876 (1983).     When a client asserts a claim against an attorney on the basis of lost settlement opportunity, the client   must prove not only a breach of duty but also that the breach caused damage. An element of such cause is   proof that the client and the party against whom a claim had been asserted would have reached agreement   to settle the litigation in an amount that was ascertainable. See McConwell v. FMG of Kansas City, Inc., 18   Kan. App. 2d 839, 1, 861 P.2d 830 (1993).     In Miller v. Sloan, Listrom, Eisenbarth, Sloan and Glassman, 267 Kan. 245, 978 P.2d 922 (1999),   the Supreme Court found that the defendant law firm had breached its duty to notify the plaintiff (a doctor)   of a hearing scheduled for court approval of a settlement between the plaintiff’s insurer, a claimant, and   the Health Care Stabilization Fund. Nevertheless, the court found that summary judgment on behalf of the   defendant law firm was proper because the plaintiff had made no showing of damage: “There can be no   finding of malpractice absent a showing of both departure from standards and causal injury.” 267 Kan. at   258.      In order to prevail on a claim of legal malpractice, a plaintiff is required to show (1) the duty of the   attorney to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) a causal connection between   the breach of duty and the resulting injury, and (4) actual loss or damage. Additionally, to prove legal   malpractice in the handling of litigation, a plaintiff must establish the validity of the underlying claim by   showing that it would have resulted in a favorable judgment in the underlying lawsuit had it not been for the   attorney’s error. Canaan v. Bartee, 276 Kan. 116, 72 P.3d 911 (2003), cert. denied 540 U.S. 1090, 124 S.   Ct. 962, 157 L. Ed. 2d 795 (2003). Under Canaan, a person convicted in a criminal action must first obtain   post-conviction relief before maintaining an action against his or her former criminal defense counsel.      2020      "      2020      In the absence of a basis for awarding actual damages, a claim for punitive damages must also fail.   Furthermore, the provisions of K.S.A. 60-3703 that permit a court to decide whether punitive damages can   be submitted is constitutional. See McConwell v. FMG of Kansas City, 18 Kan. App. 2d 839, 4, 861   P.2d 830 (1993).     A legal malpractice plaintiff who bases his or her claim on ineffective assistance of counsel in a   criminal case is not required to prove actual innocence of the charged crime. See Mashaney v. Board of   Indigents' Defense Services, 302 Kan. 625, 652, 355 P.3d 667 (2015). But actual guilt may be relevant to   the proximate cause determination.

On questions of legal practice   only those qualified as experts are permitted to testify. The standard of care   is established by members of the same profession in the same or similar   communities under like circumstances. It follows, therefore, that the only way   you may properly find that standard is through evidence presented by legal   expert witnesses.

An attorney is obligated to her or his client to use reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in   the handling of cases; to use his or her best judgment; and to exercise that reasonable degree of learning,   skill and experience which is ordinarily possessed by other attorneys in the community. What constitutes      2012      "      2012      negligence in a particular situation is judged by the professional standards of the particular area of the law   in which the practitioner is involved. See McConwell v. FMG of Kansas City, Inc., 18 Kan. App. 2d 839,   8, 861 P.2d 830 (1993), and Leeper v. Schroer, Rice, Bryan & Lykins, P.A., 241 Kan. 241, 6,   736 P.2d 882 (1987).     In Bergstrom v. Noah, 266 Kan. 847, 974 P.2d 531 (1999), the Supreme Court recognized an “error   of judgment defense” to a legal malpractice action. The court emphasized that the exception was a narrow   one and could not be used where the issue is settled and can be identified through ordinary research and   investigative techniques. However, where the law is unclear, or has not been settled by the appellate courts,   or involves new occurrences not yet considered by the courts or the legislature, an attorney is not liable for   a mere error in judgment if he or she has acted in good faith and in an honest belief that his or her acts are   well founded and in the best interest of the client.

Krings, 230 Kan. 466, 638 P.2d 904 (1982), the court held that claims of loss resulting   from failure to perform an audit as required by the Kansas Savings and Loan Code, the Kansas Securities   Act and generally accepted accounting principles and from breach of implied and express warranties to   conduct the audit according to generally accepted accounting principles and from conducting audits in a   negligent, reckless or grossly reckless manner, all sounded in tort as breaches of duties imposed by law,   making the two-year statute of limitations applicable.     In Tamarac Dev. Co., Inc. v. Delamater, Freund and Assocs., 234 Kan. 618, 675 P.2d 361 (1984),   it was held that in an action against an architectural and engineering firm for breach of an oral contract to   supervise grading construction, the cause of action could be based on breach of an express contract or an   implied warranty or on negligence.

This is true even if the accountant does not think the course of action is a wise   idea and another of the accountant’s clients might benefit by it.”      2008                  "      A. CONTRACTS GENERALLY      <h4><a name='124.01' href='124.01'>124.01</a></h4><p>DEFINITION OF CONTRACT      A contract is an agreement between two or more persons consisting of a   (promise that is) (set of promises that are) legally enforceable.      Notes on Use      There is no limitation on the variety of contract cases that come before the courts except the ingenuity   of man; consequently, most of the pattern instructions in this chapter will require modification.     The UCC includes the following definitions [K.S.A. 84-1-201(3) and (12)]:     (12) “Contract” means the total legal obligation that results from the parties’ agreement as affected   by this act and any other applicable rules of law.     (3) “Agreement” means the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from      other circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade as provided in   K.S.A. 84-1-303.      Comment      Mixed questions of law and equity are often involved in contract litigation. Consequently, mixed   jury and nonjury issues are often presented. These pattern instructions are designed to aid court and   counsel when an issue of fact is properly raised. For cases concerning construction of contracts see PIK 4"   .      2010                 "      <h4><a name='124.02' href='124.02'>124.02</a></h4><p>DEFINITION OF SUBCONTRACT      A subcontract is an agreement between a person and a contractor,   whereby the person agrees to perform all or part of the work the contractor   agreed to perform under a preexisting contract with a third party.      Comment      For authority, see Calvert Western Exploration Co. v. Diamond Shamrock, 234 Kan. 699, 675 P.2d   871 (1984). A valid subcontract requires the preexistence of a prime contract between the principal and   a contractor. The subcontractor agrees with the contractor to perform all or part of the prime contract.   Basic requirements of a subcontract include, among other things, references to work to be performed,   performance bonds, and maintenance of liability insurance. J.W. Thompson Co. v. Welles Products Corp.,   243 Kan. 503, 758 P.2d 738 (1988).      2010      "       <h4><a name='124.03' href='124.03'>124.03</a></h4><p>FORMATION OF CONTRACTS      A contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement.   It may be oral or written, or implied from the conduct of the parties. (An   agreement is sufficient to constitute a contract even though the exact time of its   making cannot be determined.)      Notes on Use      This instruction may be given in any contract case. If there is a dispute over the manner of formation   of a contract, this instruction and the applicable portions of PIK 4" , Offer and Acceptance, should   be given.     K.S.A. 84-2-204(1) and (2) serve as the basis for this suggested pattern instruction.      Comment      When the evidence pertaining to the existence of a contract or the terms thereof is conflicting or   admits of more than one inference, a question is presented for the trier of facts. Hays v. Underwood, 196   Kan. 265, 411 P.2d 717 (1966).      Parties may become contractually obligated by their nonverbal conduct as well as by their use of oral   or written words. Rains v. Weiler, 101 Kan. 294, 166 P. 235 (1917). The law implies, from circumstances   and “the silent language of men’s conduct and actions, contracts, and promises as forcible and binding as   those made by express words or through the medium of written memorials.” 1 Addison, Contracts, 54 (8th   ed. 1889), quotes In re Estate of Langdon, 165 Kan. 267, 274, 195 P.2d 317 (1948).      The existence or nonexistence of a contract is a fact that may be established by direct or circumstantial   evidence. In re Estate of Miller, 186 Kan. 87, 348 P.2d 1033 (1960); Ellis v. Berry, 19 Kan. App. 2d 105,   867 P.2d 1063 (1993). In some situations, such as when there is an alleged contract to make a will, however,   the existence of the contract must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. In re Estate of Stratmann,   248 Kan. 197, 806 P.2d 459 (1991).      Where there has been substantial performance by the party not bound (under an offer for a unilateral   contract) whereby the other has received the desired or requested benefits, the promise becomes binding.   Commercial Asphalt v. Smith, 196 Kan. 164, 409 P.2d 796 (1966); and Seneca Nursing Home v. Kansas   State Bd. of Social Welfare, 490 F.2d 1324, 1332 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied 419 U.S. 841, 95 S. Ct. 72,   42 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1974).      A new contract is implied where an agreement expires by its terms, and the parties continue to   perform as before. An implication arises that they have mutually assented to a new contract containing   the same provisions as the old, and such a contractual relationship will continue until reasonable notice of   termination is given by one party to the other. Baker v. City of Topeka, 231 Kan. 328, 644 P.2d 441 (1982).   The factors to consider in determining the intent of the parties when a contract is implied in fact are stated   in Allegri v. Providence-St. Margaret Health Center, 9 Kan. App. 2d 659, 684 P.2d 1031 (1984).     This instruction was approved when there was no dispute as to whether a contract was formed in   Stover v. Superior Industries Int’l, Inc., 29 Kan. App. 2d 235, 242, 29 P.3d 967, rev. denied 270 Kan. 903   (2000).      2020                 "      <h4><a name='124.04' href='124.04'>124.04</a></h4><p>OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE      A. Meeting of the Minds      An enforceable contract requires an agreement on all essential terms   between the contracting parties. The agreement is usually made by one party   making an offer and the other party accepting it. An offer and acceptance are   commonly referred to as the acts by which the parties have a “meeting of the   minds.”      B. The Offer      An offer is a proposal by one party to another party to perform certain   actions, provided the other party will perform certain actions in return. The   terms of the proposal must be certain and the offer must be communicated   between the parties before the offer is effective. One who makes an offer is   called an offeror and the one accepting is called the offeree.      C. Duration of the Offer      The offer continues until: (1) there is a lapse of the time specified; (2) if   no time is specified, by the lapse of a reasonable time; (3) the withdrawal by   the offeror; or (4) the rejection by the offeree.      D. The Acceptance      An acceptance is an unqualified promise by the offeree that (he) (she) will   be bound by the terms of the offer. The acceptance must be communicated   to the offeror before the acceptance is effective. If the offer was received by   (mail) (telegram) the acceptance is effective when it is deposited (in the mail)   (with the telegraph company).      E. Counter-Offer or Rejection      An acceptance which departs from the terms of the original offer by   proposing new or additional terms is known as a counter-offer. A counter-   offer rejects the original offer. If the counter-offer is accepted by the original   offeror there is a binding contract.      Notes on Use      The applicable parts should be given when there is a dispute over the formation of a contract. If   the contract involves the sale of personal property that is covered by the law of sales, codified under the   Uniform Commercial Code, K.S.A. 84-2-101 et seq., this pattern should not be given.      2020      "      2010      Comment      The suggested pattern is framed under traditional concepts of contract law. These concepts have been   modified by the Uniform Commercial Code when it involves the sale of personal property.      The essential terms of an offer must be stated with sufficient degree of certainty as to be capable of   enforcement. Essential terms are stated by Simpson, Handbook on the Law of Contracts (2d ed.) p 19 to   include the following:     “Essential terms include identification of the subject matter, the price to be paid, the   time of performance, or the work to be done. Missing terms such as price, or the time of   delivery or completion, will be supplied where possible by an inference that a reasonable   price, or delivery at a reasonable time was intended. However, such an inference is not   possible where the offer or agreement attempts to cover these terms and fails to achieve   intelligible certainty. In such case, the contract fails. Employment contracts lacking   certainty as to the duration constitute an exception to the rule which invokes the standard   of reasonableness.”     The essential elements of a contract under the Uniform Commercial Code or K.S.A. 84-2-201 were   stated in Southwest Engineering Co., Inc. v. Martin Tractor Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 684, 473 P.2d 18 (1970).   For a general discussion of the requirements of definiteness and certainty of offers, see 17A Am. Jur. 2d,   Contracts §§ 192 et seq.     The Kansas Supreme Court has consistently held that in order to form a binding contract there must   be a meeting of the minds on all the essential terms. See Phillips & Easton Supply Co., Inc. v. Eleanor   International Inc., 212 Kan. 730, 512 P.2d 379 (1973); Storts v. Eby Construction Co., 217 Kan. 34, 535   P.2d 908 (1975); and Steele v. Harrison, 220 Kan. 422, 552 P.2d 957 (1976). Yet, the omission of a single   term is not necessarily fatal if conduct of the parties indicates there is an intent to be bound. Arrowhead   Construction Co. v. Essex Corp., 233 Kan. 241, 662 P.2d 1195 (1983). Also, the mere fact a contract   contains blanks when signed does not make it invalid. However, it is a voidable contract if material parts   are filled in an unauthorized manner. Sidwell Oil & Gas Co. v. Loyd, 230 Kan. 77, 630 P.2d 1107 (1981).      Two persons may fully agree upon the terms of the contract knowing that there are other matters on   which they have not agreed and on which they expect further negotiations. Such an expectation does not   prevent the agreement already made from being an enforceable contract. See Storts v. Eby Construction   Co., 217 Kan. 34, 535 P.2d 908 (1975). On the other hand, where the parties have negotiated with a definite   understanding that no contract is to exist until execution of a written agreement, a binding contract does   not come into existence until the written instrument is executed. See Weil & Associates v. Urban Renewal   Agency, 206 Kan. 405, 479 P.2d 875 (1971).     An agreement to form a contract in the future is generally not binding unless all essential terms are   agreed upon and nothing essential is left to future negotiations. Mohr v. State Bank of Stanley, 244 Kan.   555, 770 P.2d 466 (1989).     The determination of the existence of a sufficient meeting of the minds to form the basis for a      binding contract is one of fact to be determined by the trier of the facts. Care Display, Inc. v. Didde-Glaser,   Inc., 225 Kan. 232, Syl. 1 3, 589 P.2d 599 (1979).                             <h4><a name='124.05' href='124.05'>124.05</a></h4><p>MISTAKE      A. Mutual Mistake      A party may be relieved of contractual responsibility if both parties made   the same mistake concerning a basic assumption or material fact upon which   the contract was based.      B. Unilateral Mistake      A party may be relieved of contractual responsibility if that party made   a mistake concerning a basic assumption or material fact upon which the   contract was based, and the other party to the contract (knew of that mistake)   (had reason to know of the mistake) (caused the mistake).      Comment      In the case of Geiger v. Hansen, 214 Kan. 83, 519 P.2d 699 (1974), the Kansas Supreme Court   acknowledged that there was authority for relieving a party of contractual duties involving a unilateral   mistake if enforcement of the contract would effect substantial injustice. See also Squires v. Woodbury, 5   Kan. App. 2d 596, 621 P.2d 443 (1980).     A mutual mistake in a written contract is one made by all parties thereto. Zuspann v. Roy, 102 Kan.   188, 170 P. 387 (1918). A misunderstanding of the terms of a bargain by one party is insufficient to relieve   that party from its terms. Relief can only be invoked upon a showing of mutual mistake, fraud, or want of   authority. Green v. Bankers’ Life Ins. Co., 112 Kan. 50, 209 P. 670 (1922).     A contracting party is under a duty to learn the facts of a written contract before signing it, and if,   without being a victim of fraud, he fails to read it, he signs the same at his peril. Sutherland v. Sutherland, 187   Kan. 599, 610, 358 P.2d 776 (1961); Maltby v. Sumner, 169 Kan. 417, 219 P.2d 395 (1950). Nonetheless, in   Andres v. Claassen, 238 Kan. 732, 741, 714 P.2d 963, 969 (1986), the Kansas Supreme Court stated “ ... that   an instrument may be reformed where there is ignorance or mistake on one side and fraud or inequitable   conduct on the other.”      Although a person cannot read an instrument he has a duty to procure some reliable person to read   and explain it. Miner v. Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co., Inc., 17 Kan. App. 2d 598, 841 P.2d 1093 (1992).     Everyone is presumed to know the law and a mistake of law made by one party to the contract does   not excuse that party from the obligations of the contract. Flott v. Wenger Mixer Manufacturing Co., 189   Kan. 80, 367 P.2d 44 (1961). However, a mutual mistake of law can preclude formation of a contract.   Albers v. Nelson, 248 Kan. 575, 809 P.2d 1194 (1991); Rosenbaum v. Texas Energies, Inc., 241 Kan. 295,   736 P.2d 888 (1987).     Either party may prove mistake and have reformation of the contract. Geiger v. Hansen, 214 Kan.   83, 519 P.2d 699 (1974).     However, the successful bidder for a public construction contract will not be granted equitable relief,   by way of cancellation of the construction bid and the discharge and relief from its bid bond, because of      a unilateral error in calculating costs. Triple A Contractors, Inc. v. Rural Water Dist. No. 4, 226 Kan. 626,   Syl. $ 1, 603 P.2d 184 (1979).      "      2012      "      2010      Where suit is brought for performance of a written contract, parol evidence is admissible to show   that there was no consent to the agreement by reason of mutual mistake. Sidwell Oil & Gas Co. v. Loyd,   230 Kan. 77, 630 P.2d 1107 (1981).     A provision in a written contract which provides that time is of the essence may be nullified where   mutual mistake or fraud is established. Campbell v. Fowler, 214 Kan. 491, 497, 520 P.2d 1285 (1974).     A mistake justifying rescission need not be mutual, but a unilateral mistake by one party justifies   relief if the mistaken fact goes to the basis of the transaction and was known by the other party. Potucek v.   Cordeleria Lourdes, 310 F.2d 527 (10" Cir. 1962), cert. denied 372 U.S. 930, 83 S. Ct. 875, 9 L. Ed. 2d 734   (1963).     For a party to be successful in a claim of mutual mistake, the mistake must be as to a past or present   fact material to the contract and not a mere mistake in prophecy, opinion or belief relative to an uncertain   event. Krantz v. University of Kansas, 271 Kan. 234, 244, 21 P.3d 561 (2001).                  "      <h4><a name='124.06' href='124.06'>124.06</a></h4><p>FORMATION OF CONTRACTS—INTOXICATED PERSON      A party may be relieved of (his) (her) contract responsibility by reason of   intoxication only if the following are proven:      1. that (he) (she) was intoxicated at the time the contract   was signed;     2. that during this time (he) (she) lacked the power to reason   and comprehend the nature and consequences of (his) (her)   act(s); and     3. that the other (party) (parties) to the contract knew or   had reason to know that (he) (she) was unable to understand the   nature and consequences of (his) (her) act(s).      Comment      In Curry v. Stewart, 189 Kan. 153, 156, 368 P.2d 297 (1962), the court stated that “an habitual drunkard   is not necessarily incompetent as a matter of law, and, in the absence of an adjudication finding an habitual   drunkard to be incompetent, in order to avoid his contract or deed on the ground of his incompetency it   must be shown that his mental condition was such at the time the contract or deed was made that he lacked   the power of reason and was unable to comprehend the nature and consequences of his act in entering into   the contract or executing the deed.” See also Jn re Estate of Crawford, 176 Kan. 537, 541, 271 P.2d 240   (1954), and Mills v. Shepherd, 159 Kan. 668, 157 P.2d 533 (1945).       2010      "      2010      <h4><a name='124.07' href='124.07'>124.07</a></h4><p>FORMATION OF CONTRACT—DURESS      A party may be relieved of (his) (her) contractual responsibility if (he)   (she) became a party to the transaction while under duress. Duress is any   wrongful threat, by words or other conduct, which was intended or should   reasonably have been expected to cause such fear as to deny the threatened   party the exercise of free will and judgment in (his) (her) decision to enter into   a transaction. The test is whether or not the threat put the party in such fear   that (he) (she) could not exercise free will and judgment.      Comment      Although the ultimate question regarding the existence or nonexistence of free will is a matter for   jury determination, the court must initially conclude that the evidence submitted to establish duress is   substantial. Motor Equipment Co. v. McLaughlin, 156 Kan. 258, 266, 133 P.2d 149 (1943).      The statute of limitations does not begin to run in an action for relief on the ground of duress by   threats while the mind of the aggrieved party continues to be dominated by such threats. Eureka Bank v.   Bay, 90 Kan. 506, 509, 135 P. 584 (1913).     It is not duress for one to threaten the use of the law to its full extent against another. Riney v. Doll,   116 Kan. 26, 225 P. 1059 (1924).     For discussion of the elements of duress and the burden of proof, see Libel v. Libel, 5 Kan. App. 2d   367, 616 P.2d 306 (1980).      When the party alleging duress is a corporation, duress of one corporate representative does not   necessarily equate to duress of the corporation. When corporate action requires the vote of more than one   corporate representative, duress of one of the corporate representatives does not necessarily mean that the   other corporate representatives are under duress, or that the corporation as a plaintiff or defendant cannot   exercise free will and judgment. However, the representative acting under duress may influence the other   representatives, such that they and the corporation are also acting under duress. McConwell v.

In determining whether there was undue influence, you should consider   all the circumstances, including:      e the relationship of the parties;      e the timing and manner of the suggestion, advice, or other   pressure;      e the motive for the suggestion, advice, or other pressure; and   e the effect of the suggestion, advice, or other pressure.      Fair argument and persuasion do not amount to undue influence.      Notes on Use      The instruction should be given when the defense of undue influence is claimed. If the claim of   undue influence is based on a confidential or fiduciary relationship this instruction should not be given. In   that case, PIK 4  should be used. If the defense of independent advice is asserted, PIK 4    should be given.      Comment      Authority for the instruction is found in Smith v. McHenry, 111 Kan. 659, 663, 207 P. 1108 (1922);   Linn v. Blanton, 111 Kan. 743, 208 P. 616 (1922); 25 Am. Jur. 2d, Duress and Undue Influence § 31.      In the absence of a confidential or fiduciary relationship, the burden of proof on the claim of undue   influence is upon the party asserting it. Williston on Contracts p 1626. Where a confidential relationship   is shown to exist, the burden of proof is upon the confidant to show by convincing evidence that no undue   influence was exercised. Jn re Estate of Carlson, 201 Kan. 635, 648, 443 P.2d 339 (1968).      “Whether a contracting party has been unduly influenced presents a question of fact turning upon   the particulars of the transaction. Undue influence requires that degree of pressure sufficient to overpower   the party’s free will. A fact-finder should consider all the circumstances, including the relationship of   the parties; the timing and manner of suggestion, advice, or other pressure; the motive for applying that   pressure; and the effect of the pressure.” Moore v. Moore, 56 Kan. App. 2d 301, Syl. § 5, 429 P.3d 607   (2018), rev. denied 309 Kan. 1348 (2019).     The defense of undue influence is commonly asserted in will contests. See Ginter v. Ginter, 79   Kan. 721, 101 P. 634 (1909); In re Estate of Hall, 165 Kan. 465, 195 P.2d 612 (1948); In re Estate of   Crawford, 176 Kan. 537, 271 P.2d 240 (1954); In re Estate of Carlson, 201 Kan. 635, 443 P.2d 339 (1968),   and a number of cases found in Hatcher’s Kansas Digest, Vol. 5, Wills 78, 80. To invalidate a will, undue   influence must amount to coercion, compulsion, or constraint which destroys a person’s free agency and   overcomes the power of resistance. The influencer must also bear directly on the person’s actions and      2020                   "      particular parties must benefit as a result of the pressure. In re Estate of Koch, 18 Kan. App. 2d 188, 849   P.2d 977 (1993). However, the law of Kansas does not provide for jury trial in will contests. Evans v. Evans,   109 Kan. 608, 201 P. 60 (1921); Sharp v. Losee, 109 Kan. 211, 199 P. 94 (1921); Cole v. Drum, 109 Kan.      148, 197 P. 1105 (1921). In a will contest the jury is merely advisory and the court is bound to follow its   own judgment. Maddy v. Hock, 134 Kan. 15, 4 P.2d 408 (1931).      2020      "      2020      A party may be relieved of (his) (her) contractual responsibility by reason   of undue influence if (he) (she) was deprived of (his)(her) free will or agency   to contract, and if the will of another was substituted in its place.

[You must determine whether a “confidential or fiduciary   relationship” existed between the parties. In determining   whether a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed you should   consider all the facts and circumstances of the relationship. |     A confidential or fiduciary relationship is any relationship of   blood, business, friendship or association in which one of the   parties places special trust and confidence in the other.     A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists in a case in which   there has been a special confidence placed in one who, in equity   and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due   regard to the interest of the one placing the confidence.   (Because the court found as a matter of law there was a   confidential or fiduciary relationship,) (If you find that a   confidential or fiduciary relationship existed,) __insert name of   allegedly dominated party _ is relieved of (his)(her) contractual      responsibility unless you are persuaded that insert name      of allegedly dominated par was not unduly influenced by      insert name of allegedly dominating party _. __Insert name of   allegedly dominating party has the burden to prove the absence      of undue influence.   If you do not find that a confidential or fiduciary relationship      existed, __ insert name of allegedly dominated party _ has the      burden to prove undue influence to be relieved of (his)(her)   contractual responsibility. ]                        3.or4. In determining whether there was undue influence you should   consider all the circumstances, including:      e the relationship of the parties;     e the timing and manner of the suggestion, advice, or other   pressure;     ° the motive for the suggestion, advice or other pressure;   and     ° the effect of the suggestion, advice or other pressure.      Fair argument and persuasion do not amount to undue influence.      Notes on Use      For authority, see Moore v. Moore, 56 Kan. App. 2d 301, 429 P.3d 607 (2018), rev. denied 309 Kan.   1348 (2019).     The name of the allegedly dominated or dominating party should be inserted where applicable.     This instruction should be given in a case in which there is a claim of undue influence and: 1) the   court finds as a matter of law that a fiduciary or confidential relationship existed, or 2) the existence of a   fiduciary or confidential relationship is a question of fact for the jury.     This instruction should not be given ifthe court finds as a matter of law that no fiduciary or confidential   relationship existed. In that case, PIK 4"  should be given.     If the court determines as a matter of law that there was a fiduciary or confidential relationship, the   bracketed paragraph in Element 1 and the bracketed Element 3 should not be given. Bracketed Element 3   should be given only when the second parenthetical in Element 2 is selected.      Comment      “When parties occupy a confidential relationship, the courts require the trusted party to prove the   absence of undue influence over the trusting party in bargaining and contract formation.” Moore v. Moore,   56 Kan. App. 2d 301, Syl. 1 2, 429 P.3d 607 (2018), rev. denied 309 Kan. 1348 (2019). “In a will contest,   unlike a contract dispute, the burden to prove the absence of undue influence shifts to a legatee only   when he or she occupied a confidential relationship with the testator and the bequest invites suspicion.”   Moore, Syl. 1 3. “Kansas appellate courts have declined to fashion an overarching definition of confidential   relationships and defer, instead, to an inquiry into the particular facts of a given case.” Moore, Syl. 4.   “Whether a contracting party has been unduly influenced presents a question of fact turning upon the   particulars of the transaction. Undue influence requires that degree of pressure sufficient to overpower   the party’s free will. A fact-finder should consider all the circumstances, including the relationship of   the parties; the timing and manner of suggestion, advice, or other pressure; the motive for applying that   pressure; and the effect of the pressure.” Moore, Syl. $ 5.     When a confidential relationship is shown to exist between parties to a contract, a presumption of   undue influence is established. The burden of proof shifts to the confidant to show that the contract was   made in good faith and was not induced by undue influence. Henks v. Panning, 175 Kan. 424, 264 P.2d 483   (1953); In re Estate of Crawford, 176 Kan. 537, 541, 271 P.2d 240 (1954).     Kansas appellate courts have used the terms “fiduciary” and “confidential” relationships   interchangeably. For example, in its discussion of the parties’ relationship in Moore v. Moore, supra, the      "      2020      "      2020      Court of Appeals cited both Brown v. Foulks, 232 Kan. 424, , 657 P.2d 501 (1983), and Nelson v.   Nelson, 38 Kan. App. 2d 64, 78 (2007), aff’d 288 Kan. 570, 205 P.3d 715 (2009). In Brown, the Supreme   Court held that the term “fiduciary relation” refers to “any relationship of blood, business, friendship, or   association in which one of the parties reposes special trust and confidence in the other who is in a position   to have and exercise influence over the first party.” In Ne/son, the Court of Appeals used identical language   to define a “confidential relationship.”      In In re Estate of Carlson, 201 Kan. 635, 648, 443 P.2d 339 (1968), the Supreme Court of Kansas   stated that “[c]ourts view with suspicion gifts or contracts between parties occupying a confidential or   fiduciary relationship and will scrutinize them closely and rescind or cancel them unless the one claiming   thereunder shows by convincing evidence there was no restraint or undue influence or undue advantage   obtained, and that there was good faith on his part.”      The relationships that commonly fall within the rule are those of parent and child; guardian and   ward; husband and wife; physician and patient; attorney and client; and clergyman and parishioner. See   Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 177 comment a. However, the mere existence of a parent and child   relationship is not enough to establish a confidential relationship. In re Estate of Koch, 18 Kan. App. 2d   188, 849 P.2d 977 (1993). For discussion of the elements to consider in determining whether a confidential   relationship exists, see In re Adoption of Irons, 235 Kan. 540, 684 P.2d 332 (1984).                  "      <h4><a name='124.11' href='124.11'>124.11</a></h4><p>FORMATION OF CONTRACTS—UNDUE INFLUENCE—   DEFENSE OF INDEPENDENT ADVICE      It is a defense to a claim of undue influence that (insert name   of allegedly dominated person) received independent advice from a person   who was both qualified to give the advice and had no personal interest in the   outcome of the transaction.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be used when a party claims that the allegedly dominated person received   independent advice in the exercise of his or her free will. See the Notes on Use and Comment in PIK 4%   , Formation of Contracts—Undue Influence, and , Formation of Contracts—Confidential or   Fiduciary Relationship— Undue Influence—Burden of Proof.      Comment      In In re Estate of Carlson, 201 Kan. 635, , 443 P.2d 339 (1968), the Supreme Court of Kansas   held that “the rule of independent advice is applied only under circumstances where the evidence warrants   it [and that it is not required] where the party upon whom is cast the burden of showing good faith presents   substantial evidence that the deed or contract was made in good faith, not induced by undue influence, and   for a valuable consideration.” See also In re Estate of Relihan, 4 Kan. App. 2d 277, 604 P.2d 1219 (1980).      The Supreme Court of Kansas defined the term “independent advice” in Flintjer v. Rehm, 120 Kan.   13, 17, 241 P. 1087 (1926), to mean “that the donor had the preliminary benefit of conferring fully and   privately upon the subject of his intended gift with a person who was not only competent to inform him   correctly as to its legal effect, but who was, furthermore, so disassociated from the interests of the donee as   to be in a position to advise with the donor impartially and confidentially as to the consequences to himself   of his proposed benefaction.”       2020      "       <h4><a name='124.12' href='124.12'>124.12</a></h4><p>CONSIDERATION      For a promise to be legally enforceable, something of value must   be bargained for and given in exchange for the promise. This is called   consideration.      “Something of value” may consist of a promise (such as a promise to pay   money or to perform services or to deliver goods), an act (such as the payment of   money, the delivery of goods, or the performance of services), or a forbearance   (such as forbearance to sue, to compete, to promise, or to act).      Notes on Use      This instruction need not be given unless there is a dispute about the existence of consideration.     K.S.A. 16-107 provides that all contracts in writing signed by the party bound thereby, or his   authorized agent or attorney, shall import a consideration. K.S.A. 16-108 provides that the want or failure   of consideration may be shown as a defense.      Comment      If a contract is in writing, there is a presumption that consideration exists. If lack of consideration   is asserted in such circumstances, substantial evidence will be needed to overcome the presumption. State   ex rel. Ludwick v. Bryant, 237 Kan. 47, 697 P.2d 858 (1985). See K.S.A. 16-107 and 16-108. Where the   existence of consideration for a contract is controverted, the issue must be submitted to the jury unless the   parties consent to a decision by the court. Ferraro v. Fink, 191 Kan. 53, 56, 379 P.2d 266 (1963); Fieser v.   Stinnett, 212 Kan. 26, 33, 509 P.2d 1156 (1973).     Want of consideration for a contract in writing is an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof is   upon him who asserts it. Boner v. Texas Co., 143 Kan. 746, 57 P.2d 420 (1936).     Consideration has been defined as any benefit, profit, or advantage flowing to the promisor which   he would not have received but for the contract, or any loss or detriment to the promisee. State Investment   Co. v. Cimarron Insurance Co., 183 Kan. 190, 195, 326 P.2d 299 (1958); Temmen v. Kent-Brown Chevrolet   Co., 217 Kan. 223, 231, 535 P.2d 873 (1975). If consideration is sufficient, it does not matter whether it is   given by a promisee or a third party. Boos v. National Fed’n of State High School Ass’ns, 20 Kan. App. 2d   517, 889 P.2d 797 (1995).     While want of consideration usually indicates a total lack of consideration at the time of formation,   and failure indicates nonperformance later [17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts § 670], “failure of consideration”   is sometimes treated as meaning the same as “want of consideration.” Karl v. Maloney, 111 Kan. 93, 205 P.   1037 (1922).      Detriment means giving up a valuable right the promisee was privileged to have or retain.      2020                   "      <h4><a name='124.13' href='124.13'>124.13</a></h4><p>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL      A promise that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce, and   does induce, action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character   on the part of the promisee is binding if injustice can be avoided only by   enforcement of the promise.      Comment      The doctrine of promissory estoppel is a substitute for consideration. It finds application in family   settlement agreements, promises to convey land, and the like. It differs from ordinary equitable estoppel in   that the representation is promissory rather than to existing fact. Marker v. Preferred Fire Ins. Co., 211 Kan.   427, 434, 506 P.2d 1163 (1973). Furthermore, it requires less proof than an action based on a fraudulent   promise of future events. See PIK 4" , Fraud—Promise of Future Events.      The doctrine is recognized in Jn re Estate of Shirk, 186 Kan. 311, 321, 350 P.2d 1 (1960); French   v. French, 161 Kan. 327, 331, 167 P.2d 305 (1946), cert. denied 329 U.S. 727, 67 S. Ct. 81, 91 L. Ed. 629   (1946); and Greiner v. Greiner, 131 Kan. 760, 765, 293 P. 759 (1930).      Before the doctrine may be invoked, the evidence must show: (1) that the promisor reasonably   expected the promisee to rely on the promise, (2) that the promisee acted reasonably in reliance, and (3) that   refusal to enforce the promise would result in fraud or injustice. Marker v. Preferred Fire Ins. Co., 211 Kan.   427, 506 P.2d 1163; Berryman v. Kmoch, 221 Kan. 304, 559 P.2d 790 (1977); Patrons Mutual Ins. Ass’n v.   Union Gas System, Inc., 250 Kan. 722, 830 P.2d 35 (1992); Mohr v. State Bank of Stanley, 244 Kan. 555,   770 P.2d 466 (1989).      The phrases “enforcement of a promise because of reliance,” “action-in-reliance,” and “promissory   estoppel” are used synonymously with reference to the rule articulated in Restatement of Contracts § 90   (1932). Kirkpatrick v. Seneca National Bank, 213 Kan. 61, 68, 515 P.2d 781 (1973).      Promissory estoppel may be used to enforce a promise otherwise unenforceable by operation of the   statute of frauds. Decatur Cooperative Association v. Urban, 219 Kan. 171, 547 P.2d 323 (1976); Walker v.   Treton, 221 Kan. 314, 559 P.2d 340 (1977). Before promissory estoppel can be invoked in a case involving   the Statute of Frauds, the promise must show a valid and otherwise enforceable contract was entered into   by the parties. Owasso Dev. Co. v. Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 19 Kan. App. 2d 549, 873 P.2d 212   (1994).      39 66      2020      "       <h4><a name='124.14' href='124.14'>124.14</a></h4><p>CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACTS      Comment      No instruction has been provided. The Committee recommends that in every contract case the court   describe the contract between the parties as simply as possible and then define the issues of fact arising out   of the alleged breach.      2020                   "      <h4><a name='124.15' href='124.15'>124.15</a></h4><p>JOINT CONTRACTS      When two or more persons have joined in obligating themselves by   contract, each person is wholly liable. The obligation may be enforced against   any one or more of such persons. (The release of any one of such persons does   not release the others from the obligation, except as to the amount paid for the   release.)      Notes on Use      This instruction is not applicable when the obligation involved is several only. The parenthetical   expression should be used when the evidence indicates that other obligors have been released.     K.S.A. 16-101 provides that all contracts that by the common law are joint only shall be construed   to be joint and several.     K.S.A. 16-102 and 103 provide for the survivorship of joint obligations in case of the death of one   or more of the joint obligors.     K.S.A. 16-104 provides that in all cases of joint obligations, suits may be brought against any one or   more of those who are so liable.     K.S.A. 16-105 provides that any person jointly or severally liable with others for the payment of   any debt may be released from such liability by the creditor, and such release shall not discharge the other   obligors beyond the proper proportion of the debt for which the person released was liable.     K.S.A. 84-3-116(a), relating to negotiable instruments, provides that when more than one party signs   an instrument in a particular capacity, such as maker, acceptor, drawer, or endorser, all such signing parties   are jointly and severally liable in that capacity unless the instrument provides otherwise. See also K.S.A.   84-3-402, relating to the obligation of one signing commercial paper in a representative capacity.      Comment      In Misco Leasing, Inc. v. Bush, 208 Kan. 45, 490 P.2d 367 (1971), the Supreme Court of Kansas held   that “[t]he theory of joint and several liability is that it is the obligation of all jointly and the obligation   of each separately. K.S.A. 16-105 cannot apply when each of the parties are liable for the whole of the   indebtedness.”     When debtors are jointly and severally liable on an obligation, the release of one debtor discharges   the remaining debtors only to the extent of the consideration paid for the release.

Notes on Use      The court should determine as a matter of law the elements of damage that are properly recoverable   under the evidence, and each element should be listed. Jenkins v. Kirtley, 70 Kan. 801, 79 P. 671 (1905).     PIK 4" , Measure of Damages—Personal or Property—Short Form, with slight modification,   may also suffice in breach of contract actions.      With reference to actions for breach of sales contracts, see K.S.A. 84-2-701 through 725.      Comment      Damages recoverable for breach of contract are limited to those damages which may fairly be   considered as arising, in the usual course of things, from the breach, or as may reasonably be assumed to   have been within the contemplation of both parties as the probable result of the breach. Damages that are   not the result of the breach, and those which are remote, cannot serve to support a judgment. Kansas State   Bank v. Overseas Motosport, Inc., 222 Kan. 26, 27, 563 P.2d 414 (1977), and the cases cited therein. This is   the doctrine of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Reprint 145, 5 Eng. Rul. Cas. 502 (1854). See   Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351; Enlow v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 249 Kan. 732, 822 P.2d 617   (1991).     If the agreement contains provisions fixing the measure of recovery in case of breach, such provisions   are controlling. Anderson v. Rexroad, 180 Kan. 505, 306 P.2d 137 (1957); Kvassay v. Murray, 15 Kan. App.   2d 426, 808 P.2d 896 (1991); and see K.S.A. 84-2-718, 719. An exception to this rule exists concerning   stipulations for liquidated damages that have little or no relation to actual damages. Where a stipulated   amount of damages to be paid for a breach of contract does not bear a reasonable relationship to the   damages that may be expected to follow from the breach, such stipulated sums will be construed to be   “penalties.” National Coop Refinery Ass’n v. Northern Ordnance, Inc., 238 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1956).     A party who is injured by a breach of a contract is entitled to compensation for the injury sustained,   and is to be placed, so far as it can be done by a money award, in the same position he would have occupied   if the contract had been performed. Steel v. Eagle, 207 Kan. 146, 151, 483 P.2d 1063 (1971).     Loss of profits resulting from a breach of contract may be recovered as damages when such profits      are proved with reasonable certainty and when they may reasonably be considered to have been within   the contemplation of the parties. Vickers v. Wichita State University, 213 Kan. 614, 518 P.2d 512 (1974);                              "      Butler v.

Where there is no uncertainty as to the amount which is due under a contract or the date on which it   became due, the creditor is entitled to recover interest from the due date. Arrowhead Constr. Co. v. Essex   Corp., 233 Kan. 241, 662 P.2d 1195 (1983).      When a personal services contract is breached, the aggrieved party may recover the cost of obtaining   equivalent service plus any foreseeable consequential costs of the breach, reduced by the amount of wages   that remain unpaid to the breaching party. Source Direct, Inc. v. Mantell, 19 Kan. App. 2d 399, 870 P.2d 686   (1994).      2020      "       <h4><a name='124.17' href='124.17'>124.17</a></h4><p>MEASURE OF DAMAGES UNDER QUANTUM MERUIT      Where a party furnishes goods or performs services for another and has a   reasonable expectation of being compensated, the one benefited is responsible   for paying the reasonable worth of the goods provided or services rendered.      Plaintiff claims to have provided the following goods or services:   (State elements of plaintiff’s claim.)      The total amount of your award may not exceed the sum of $ , the   amount of the plaintiff’s claim.      Notes on Use      For authority, see Sharman v. Webber Supply Co., 201 Kan. 507, 441 P.2d 867 (1968).      Comment      Where a contract is terminated or abandoned after partial performance, the doctrine of quantum   meruit may be applicable. Sharman v. Webber Supply Co., 201 Kan. 507, 441 P.2d 867 (1968).      The elements of quantum meruit are: a benefit conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff, an   appreciation or knowledge of the benefit by the defendant, and acceptance or retention of the benefit by   the defendant under circumstances in which such acceptance or retention is not equitable without payment   for its value. Haz-Mat Response, Inc. v. Certified Waste Services, Ltd., 21 Kan. App. 2d 56, 896 P.2d 393   (1995), aff'd in part and rev'd in part 259 Kan. 166, 910 P.2d 839 (1996).     Where there is no evidence showing that services were to be gratuitous, there is an implied promise   to pay for accepted service. Brakensiek v. Shaffer, 203 Kan. 817, 457 P.2d 511 (1969).     Where the minds of the parties do not meet on the essential terms of the contract, the party who   furnished material or rendered services to the other party, relying on the terms as he understood them, is   entitled to recover the reasonable worth of material and services. Campbell-Leonard Realtors v. El Matador   Apartment Co., 220 Kan. 659, 556 P.2d 459 (1976).      A party who contracts with a city cannot recover under quantum meruit when the city officials that   created the contract did so without the authority necessary to enter such a contract. Blevins v. Board of   Douglas County Comm rs, 251 Kan. 374, 834 P.2d 1344 (1992).      2020                   "      <h4><a name='124.18' href='124.18'>124.18</a></h4><p>MITIGATION OF LOSS      If you find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for breach of   the contract, then in fixing the amount of damages you should not include   any loss that (he) (she) (it) could have prevented by reasonable care and   diligence.      Notes on Use      One claiming damages for breach of contract has the same duty to mitigate his loss as does a tort   claimant. See PIK 4" , Duty to Mitigate Damages.      For provisions relating to sales cases, see K.S.A. 84-2-706 through 84-2-712.      Comment      In Cain v. Grosshans & Petersen, Inc., 196 Kan. 497, 413 P.2d 98 (1966), the Supreme Court stated   that “[w]here a party has been injured by a breach of contract he has a duty to minimize his loss to the extent   reasonably possible under existing circumstances. We acknowledge this as the general rule in Kansas.”      In Theis v. duPont, Glore Forgan, Inc., 212 Kan. 301, 307, 510 P.2d 1212 (1973), the Supreme Court   qualified the use of the term “duty” and held that “[t]he rule, more properly stated, is simply that damages   are not recoverable for harm that the plaintiff should have foreseen and could have avoided by reasonable   effort without undue risk, expense or humiliation.” Yet, expenses of a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort   to mitigate loss are recoverable. Evidence of the failure of a claimant to take reasonable action to mitigate   his loss may be shown in reduction of damages. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 350.     In Kansas, mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense, the establishment of which devolves   upon the party asserting it. Rockey v. Bacon, 205 Kan. 578, 583, 470 P.2d 804 (1970).     In an action brought to recover damages for nondelivery and repudiation of a contract for sale,   where no evidence was offered of any attempt to cover, the correct measure of damages was the difference   between the market price at the time the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price. Panhandle Agri-   Service, Inc. v. Becker, 231 Kan. 291, 644 P.2d 413 (1982).     “Cover,” as used in the U.C.C., is explained in K.S.A. 84-2-712 as the buyer’s procurement of   substitute goods when the seller repudiates or fails to deliver. The buyer need not “cover,” but if he fails   to attempt to cover, consequential damages, including lost profits, cannot be recovered. Panhandle Agri-   Service, Inc. v. Becker, 231 Kan. 291, 644 P.2d 413 (1982).      2020      "       <h4><a name='124.19' href='124.19'>124.19</a></h4><p>CONTRACTS BY MINORS      A. Generally      A contract by a minor is valid [unless you find that it has been disaffirmed   by (him) (her)}.      B.  Disaffirmance      A contract made by a minor may be avoided by (him) (her) within a   reasonable time after [(he) (she)| |(reaches the age of majority) (comes of age)|,   if (he) (she):      1. notifies the other party of (his) (her) disaffirmance of the   contract by some positive act or statement, and   2. restores, or offers to restore, to the other party all money   or property received by (him) (her) under the contract which   was within (his) (her) control at any time after (he) (she) reaches   the age of majority.   A person reaches the age of majority when (he) (she) becomes 18 years of   age.      Whether (insert name of minor)      e [disaffirmed the contract within a reasonable time after he   came of age]     e [performed some positive act or made some positive statement   of disaffirmance]     e [restored or offered to restore to (insert name of other   party) all property received by (him) (her) under the contract,   which was within (his) (her) control at any time after (he) (she)   reached the age of majority]     are questions of fact for you to determine.      Notes on Use      Under K.S.A. 74-32,251, certain student loans for higher education may not be disaffirmed because   of minority.     Under the rules of statutory construction set forth in K.S.A. 77-201, when used in the statute,   the phrase “under legal disability” includes persons who are within the period of minority, or who are   incapacitated, incompetent or imprisoned.     “Minor” means any person defined by K.S.A. 38-101 as being within the period of minority. It   should be noted that pursuant to K.S.A. 38-101 a person 16 years of age or older who is or has been married   shall be considered of the age of majority for the purposes of contract obligations.      2020                   "      Comment      A minor’s contract is never void, unless it is void for some reason other than minority. It is merely   voidable, and is valid unless disaffirmed within a reasonable time after majority is attained. If a contract   is for necessaries, it may not be disaffirmed. Private transportation to and from work is necessary, and   contracts therefore, such as where parties have agreed to share a ride, may not be disaffirmed. Ehrsam v.   Borgen, 185 Kan. 776, 778, 779, 347 P.2d 260 (1959).     Disaffirmance must be signified not only by refraining from any act of affirmance, but by performing   some positive act of disaffirmance which is of such a character as to show clearly an intention not to be   bound by the contract. What constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact; a disaffirmance coming   more than five years after attaining majority, and more than five years after the cause of action arose,   comes too late. Brown v. Staab, 103 Kan. 611, 176 P. 113 (1918). The filing of an action against an insurer   to recover under an uninsured motorist clause of an automobile policy can be equivalent to an implied   disaffirmation of an arbitration provision contained in the policy. Dickson v. Hoffman, 305 F. Supp. 1040   (D. Kan. 1969).     Where the evidence is conflicting, the trier of fact must determine whether the other party had good      reasons to believe the minor was an adult. Pottawatomie Airport & Flying Service, Inc. v. Winger, 176 Kan.   445, 271 P.2d 754 (1954).      2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.20' href='124.20'>124.20</a></h4><p>SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE      A party who acts in good faith and who performs substantially all that   is required of (him) (her) by a contract may recover from the other party the   contract price (less any damage sustained by the other party for minor defects   in performance).      Comment      Whether a party has substantially performed a promise under a contract is a question of fact to   be determined from the circumstances of each case. “Substantial performance” of a contract does not   contemplate exact performance of every detail, but rather performance of all important parts. Almena State   Bank v. Enfield, 24 Kan. App. 2d 834, Syl. 9 4, 954 P.2d 724 (1998).                  "      <h4><a name='124.21' href='124.21'>124.21</a></h4><p>PERFORMANCE PREVENTED BY PARTY      Between parties to a contract, prevention of performance constitutes a   breach. Where one party to a contract prevents complete performance of the   contract by the other party, the other party is excused from the remainder of   (his) (her) duties under the contract, and (he) (she) may recover (for the work   [he] [she] has performed) (any damages which [he] [she] has sustained as a   direct result of the breach).      Whether the defendant prevented the plaintiff from performing fully all   of (his) (her) obligations under the contract is a question of fact for you to   determine from the evidence.      Comment      A party to a contract cannot prevent performance by another and derive any benefit, or escape any   liability, from his own failure to perform a necessary promissory condition that prevents the completion of   the transaction. Wallerius v. Hare, 194 Kan. 408, 399 P.2d 543 (1965); Talbott v. Nibert, 167 Kan. 138, 206   P.2d 131 (1949); and Sharman v. Webber Supply Co., 201 Kan. 507, 515, 441 P.2d 867 (1968).     A party to a contract will not be permitted, in the absence of justifiable cause, to interfere, hinder,   or prevent performance by an adverse party and claim benefits or escape liability on the ground of   nonperformance. Briney v. Toews, 150 Kan. 489, 95 P.2d 355 (1939). However, prevention of performance   is not a breach when the contract has been properly terminated. Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Department of   Human Resources, 10 Kan. App. 2d 197, 695 P.2d 450 (1985).       2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.22' href='124.22'>124.22</a></h4><p>MODIFICATION      A contract may be modified or changed by a later oral or written   (agreement) (contract). Whether or not the parties to this action have modified   or changed the original contract is for you to determine.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given when there is an issue of fact over the modification of an existing   contract.      Comment      The terms of a written contract may be varied, modified, waived, annulled, or wholly set aside by a   subsequent contract, whether oral or written. Gibbs v. Erbert, 198 Kan. 403, 412, 424 P.2d 276 (1967).      Modification requires the assent of all parties to the contract. Mutual assent may be shown by an   express agreement, or may be implied from the circumstances and conduct of the parties. Fast v. Kahan,   206 Kan. 682, 684, 481 P.2d 958 (1971).     The intent of the parties to modify a contract may be implied from the conduct of the parties if they   do not continue to act according to the terms of the original contract. Galindo v. City of Coffeyville, 256   Kan. 455, 885 P.2d 1246 (1994).     Mutuality is required to amend the terms of a contract and one party cannot unilaterally change   its terms. Gill Mortuary v. Sutoris Inc., 207 Kan. 557, 562, 485 P.2d 1377 (1971); Dickens v. Snodgrass,   Dunlap & Co., 255 Kan. 164, 872 P.2d 252 (1994).     As a general rule, consideration is required for contracts of modification. Frogge v. Belford, 168   Kan. 74, 211 P.2d 49 (1949), adhered to 168 Kan. 582, 215 P.2d 200 (1950); Bloch v. Fedak, 210 Kan. 63,   65, 499 P.2d 1052 (1972); Augusta Medical Complex, Inc. v. Blue Cross, 227 Kan. 469, 474, 608 P.2d 890   (1980).     K.S.A. 84-2-209 provides that there need be no consideration for an agreement modifying a contract   which is governed by Article 2 of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code; that a signed agreement which   excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified; that contracts,   or modifications of contracts, involving goods of the price of $ or more must be evidenced by some   writing; and that although an attempt to modify or rescind does not satisfy the specified requirements, it   may in certain circumstances operate as a waiver.     The scope of the applicability of this section remains to be determined; but in all cases involving   sales contracts, or where there is a written contract prohibition against oral modification, this statute should   be given careful study.     Although the terms of a written contract may not be altered by a contemporaneous parol agreement,   they may be varied, modified, waived, annulled, or wholly set aside by a subsequent contract, either written   or parol. Owens v. City of Bartlett, 215 Kan. 840, 528 P.2d 1235 (1974); and Coonrod & Walz Constr. Co.,   Inc. v. Motel Enterprises, Inc., et al., 217 Kan. 63, 73, 535 P.2d 971 (1975).     For problems relating to the necessity for a modifying agreement to be in writing if the original   contract was subject to the provisions of the Statute of Frauds, see Riffel v. Dieter, 159 Kan. 628, 157 P.2d   831 (1945); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statute of Frauds §§ 1; Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 0;                              "      Hoard v.

Special problems also arise where third party beneficiaries would be affected by modification.   Different rules apply where the beneficiary is a donee and where he is a creditor. See Stanfield v. McBride,   149 Kan. 567, 88 P.2d 1002 (1939); 17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts §§ 2; and Restatement (Second) of   Contracts § 311.     The stipulation in a public construction contract that extra work or materials must be ordered in   writing can be avoided by the parties to the contract where their words, acts, or conduct amount to a waiver   or modification of the provision, or where the public entity by the acts or conduct of its proper officer   or representative is estopped to rely on it. Owens v. City of Bartlett, 215 Kan. 840, 843, 528 P.2d 1235   (1974).     Whether any term of a written contract has been modified or waived by a subsequent agreement is a   question of fact for the trial court. Coonrod & Walz Constr. Co., Inc. v. Motel Enterprises, Inc., et al, 217   Kan. 63, 535 P.2d 971 (1975).      2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.23' href='124.23'>124.23</a></h4><p>RESCISSION, CANCELLATION AND RELEASE      A. Rescission and Cancellation      Acontract not fully performed on both sides may be rescinded or canceled   by mutual agreement of the parties. An agreement to cancel a contract may   be expressed orally or in writing, or it may be implied by the conduct of the   parties. Whether there was a mutual agreement of the parties rescinding or   canceling the contract is a question of fact for you to determine.      B. Release      Arelease is in itself a contract whereby one party, in return for something   of value, known as “consideration,” gives up some right or claim (he) (she)   has against another. Whether there was a release of any obligation in this case   is a question of fact for you to determine.      As used in this instruction “something of value” may consist of a promise   (such as a promise to pay money or to perform services or to deliver goods), an   act (such as the payment of money, the delivery of goods, or the performance of   services), or a forbearance (such as forbearance to sue, to compete, to promise,   or to act).      Notes on Use      The paragraphs above are separable, and only the appropriate one should be used. The first relates to   rescission and cancellation, the second to release.   The first paragraph, dealing with rescission and cancellation, does not apply to certain contracts   under K.S.A. 84-2-209, which provides in part:   (2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed   writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants   such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the   other party.   (3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this article (section 84-2-201)   must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.   (4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of   subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.   (5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may   retract the waiver by reasonable notification.   See also K.S.A. 16-105, relating to the release of a joint obligor. Notes on Use and Comments under   PIK 4" , Promissory Estoppel, and , Joint Contracts, are applicable.                  "      Comment      Rescission and Cancellation      The Kansas rule (without reference to the Uniform Commercial Code) appears to be that the parties   to an executory contract may, at any time prior to full performance on either side, agree to cancel and   rescind. No problem of consideration is then involved. Gibbs v. Erbert, 198 Kan. 403, 412, 424 P.2d 276   (1967); 17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts § 554.     A contract for the compromise and settlement of a tort claim is subject to rescission for the same   reason as any other contract. Reynard v. Bradshaw, 196 Kan. 97, 102, 409 P.2d 1011 (1966).      An attempt to rescind a contract must be made timely if it is to be effective. Lehigh, Inc. v. Stevens,   205 Kan. 103, 108, 468 P.2d 177 (1970).     Rescission is an equitable remedy designed to afford relief from contracts entered into through   mistake, fraud, or duress. Ordinarily, the nature of relief in rescission is to place the parties in their original   position. Dreiling v. Home State Life Ins. Co., 213 Kan. 137, 147, 515 P.2d 757 (1973).     Rescission depends upon the intention of the parties as shown by their words, acts, or agreement.   Parties to a contract may mutually rescind the transaction although neither party had a right to compel a   rescission. Owens v. City of Bartlett, 215 Kan. 840, 844, 528 P.2d 1235 (1974).     In order to warrant rescission of a contract, the breach must be material and the failure to perform so   substantial as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement. Whiteley v. O’Dell, 219 Kan. 314,   316, 548 P.2d 798 (1976); Federal Land Bank of Wichita v. Krug, 253 Kan. 307, 856 P.2d 111 (1993).     Parties by their agreement cannot contract away liabilities that are imposed by operation of law.   Woods v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 220 Kan. 479, 483, 553 P.2d 900 (1976).      Where one with knowledge of the facts entitling him to rescission of the contract afterwards ratifies   it without duress, he is not entitled to have it canceled. Ordinarily an express ratification is not necessary   in order to defeat the remedy of rescission. Acts or conduct inconsistent with an intention to avoid it, or in   recognition of the contract, have the effect of an election to affirm it. Nordstrom v. Miller, 227 Kan. 59, 605   P.2d 545 (1980).     PIK 18.13(b) [PIK 4" ] was cited in Flett Construction Co., Inc. v. Williams, 210 Kan. 28, 29,   500 P.2d 54 (1972).      Release      The release of an agent, who was the tortfeasor, extinguishes the right of action against his principal,   even when the parties to the release attempt to reserve a right to proceed against the principal. Jacobson v.   Parrill, 186 Kan. 467, 351 P.2d 194 (1960).     Defenses common to a claim of release may involve questions of agency, want of capacity and   understanding, mutual mistake, fraud, duress and coercion, forged signature, want of delivery, want and   failure of consideration, illegality, and the like. No attempt can be made in this instruction to cover such   defenses, but PIK 4  (agency), PIK 4" - (fraud), and instructions throughout this   chapter may be helpful. The general rules governing contracts are applicable to releases, and instructions   in individual cases must depend upon the issues and the evidence.       2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.24' href='124.24'>124.24</a></h4><p>THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES      A party may enforce a contract expressly made for (his) (her) benefit   even though (he) (she) was not a party to the transaction.      Notes on Use      The instruction should be used in cases where a party claims certain rights as a third party beneficiary   under a contract. Authority for the instruction is found in Martin v. Edwards, 219 Kan. 466, 472, 473, 548   P.2d 779 (1976).      Comment      A valid and binding contract is essential to the right of a third party beneficiary to maintain an action   on the contract. Brown v. Wichita State University, 217 Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975) aff’d in part and   vacated in part 219 Kan. 2, 547 P.2d 1015; Cory v. Troth, 170 Kan. 50, 223 P.2d 1008 (1950).      Before the issue is reached of whether a third party may enforce a contract from which he would   benefit, the third party must show the existence of some provision in the contract that operates to his   benefit. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Western Fire Ins. Co., 226 Kan. 197, 210, 597 P.2d 622 (1979).     Third party beneficiaries generally have been divided into three classes: (1) donee, (2) creditor, and   (3) incidental. Only those beneficiaries falling into the first two classes may enforce a contract made for   their benefit. See Williston on Contracts (3d ed.) p 356; 4 Corbin on Contracts §§ 774, 779C; 17A Am. Jur.   2d, Contracts §§ 150, 6, 435 et seq.; Wilson-Cunningham v. Meyer, 16 Kan. App. 2d 197, 820 P.2d   725 (1991).      The rule in Kansas is that the primary or paramount purpose of the contract need not be to benefit   the third party before he may bring an action to enforce the contract. See Martin v. Edwards, 219 Kan. 466,   472, 473, 548 P.2d 779 (1976) and 4 Corbin on Contracts § 776. The contract may benefit the contracting   parties as well. Fasse v. Lower Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc., 241 Kan. 387, 736 P.2d 930 (1987);   Cornwall v. Jespersen, 238 Kan. 110, 708 P.2d 515 (1985).      Where a contract for the sale of realty specifically required the vendor to pay the real estate agent’s   commission, the contract was made, at least in part, for the benefit of the agent, and the agent could   maintain an action against the vendor for the commission. Holmes v. Kalbach, 173 Kan. 736, 252 P.2d 603   (1953).     A promise by the beneficiary to collect and pay the whole or part of the proceeds of a policy and   certificate of insurance to a third person is valid and enforceable against the promisor. French v.

A clause in a construction contract providing for a percentage retention of periodic payments while   the contract is being performed does not create rights in a materialman as a third party beneficiary. Holiday   Development Co. v. Tobin Construction Co., 219 Kan. 701, 549 P.2d 1376 (1976).     The intent to benefit a third party should be clearly expressed in the contract. Ronnau v. Caravan   International Corporation, 205 Kan. 154, 159, 468 P.2d 118 (1970). However, in determining whether   a contract was made for the benefit of a third party, a court may properly consider the provisions of the   contract and the circumstances and surroundings of the parties. Gust v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.,   136 Kan. 88, 91, 12 P.2d 831 (1932). Knowledge that a contract will benefit a third party does not equate to                              "      an intent to benefit the third party. Noller v. General Motors Corp., 244 Kan. 612, 772 P.2d 271 (1989). The   name of the person to be benefited by a contract need not be given if he is otherwise sufficiently described   or designated; a person so described may recover on a contract made for his benefit. Weld v. Carey, 122   Kan. 666, 253 P. 235 (1927).     When a person makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, the third person may   maintain an action to enforce the contract even though he had no knowledge of the contract and paid   none of the consideration. Martin v. Edwards, 219 Kan. 466, 548 P.2d 779 (1976); Brown v. Wichita State   University, 217 Kan. 279, 540 P.2d 66 (1975); Keith v.

Co., 278 Kan. 3, 20, 91 P.3d 531 (2004), the Supreme Court   cited  as evidence that Kansas law allows a qualified third party to enforce a contract expressly made   for his or her benefit even though they were not a party to the transaction.      2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.25' href='124.25'>124.25</a></h4><p>ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS      An assignment of a contractual right is a transfer by the owner of that   right to another party. An assignment may be written, oral, or implied by the   behavior of the parties.      An “assignor” is a person who assigns or transfers a right and an   “assignee” is a person to whom a right is transferred or assigned.      An assignment passes all the assignor’s title or interest to the assignee,   and divests the assignor of all right of control over the subject matter of the   assignment.      Notes on Use      The instruction should be given when there are issues of fact regarding the rights of an assignor and   an assignee, or an assignee and an obligor. Authority for paragraph three is found in Patrons State Bank &   Trust Co. v. Shapiro, 215 Kan. 856, 861, 528 P.2d 1198 (1974), and Army Nat’l Bank v. Equity Developers,   Inc., 245 Kan. 3, 774 P.2d 919 (1989).      Comment      For a complete discussion of the distinction between assignment of rights and delegation of duties,   see 4 Corbin on Contracts §§ 856 et seg.; Williston on Contracts (3d ed.) pp 404, 412, 3.      An assignment is an expression of intention by the assignor that his right shall pass to the assignee.   Brewer v. Harris, 147 Kan. 197, 201, 75 P.2d 287 (1938). An assignment passes all of the assignor’s title   or interest to the assignee, and divests the assignor of all right of control over the subject matter of the   assignment. Patrons State Bank & Trust Co. v. Shapiro, 215 Kan. 856, 861, 528 P.2d 1198 (1974). The   assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor, meaning that the relevant obligations, defenses, claims, etc.   that burden the assignor will equally burden the assignee. OXY USA, Inc. v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co.,   20 Kan. App. 2d 69, 883 P.2d 1216 (1994).     The right to receive monies due, and to become due, for materials and labor is subject to a valid   assignment. Hall v. Terra Cotta Co., 97 Kan. 103, 154 P. 210 (1916). For assignability of a covenant not to   compete, see Safelite Glass Corp. v. Fuller, 15 Kan. App. 2d 351, 807 P.2d 677 (1991).     The established rule forbids assignment of a cause of action based in tort. Redmon v. Salisbury Co.,   178 Kan. 639, 641, 290 P.2d 809 (1955); Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Kansas Public Ser.

However, in Kansas, all other causes in action,   including actions for breach of contract are assignable. Alldritt v. Kansas Centennial Global Exposition,   Inc., 189 Kan. 649, 657, 371 P.2d 181 (1962); Commodore v. Armour & Co., 201 Kan. 412, 441 P.2d 815   (1968).     Rights arising out of contracts involving personal services, special confidence, and the like, are not   assignable without the consent of the obligor. Campbell v. Sumner County, 64 Kan. 376, 67 P. 866 (1902);   Smith & English, Partners, v. Board of Education, 115 Kan. 155, 222 P. 101 (1924); Standard Chautauqua   System v. Gift, 120 Kan. 101, 242 P. 145 (1926).                              A party to a contract may not avoid liability on the contract by an assignment unless the other party   releases the assignor from further liability. Dondlinger & Sons’ Constr. Co. v. EMCCO, Inc., 227 Kan. 301,   606 P.2d 1026 (1980).     When an assignee seeks a written acceptance from the debtor and a written acceptance is made   subject to a condition, the debtor will not be bound unless the condition is performed. Brown v. East Side   National Bank, 196 Kan. 372, 375, 411 P.2d 605 (1966).     Consent to an assignment is not necessary to bind a debtor with notice. Apperson v. Security State   Bank, 215 Kan. 724, 734, 528 P.2d 1211 (1974). However, the notice requirement is only to protect the   debtor from being prejudiced by making payments in good faith to the original creditor. Whisler v. Whisler,   9 Kan. App. 2d 624, 684 P.2d 1025 (1984).     One who takes an assignment of a void contract acquires nothing. Kumberg v. Kumberg, 232 Kan.   692, 659 P.2d 823 (1983).

Notes on Use      The instruction should be given when there is an issue of fact concerning the waiver of performance   under a contract. Authority for the instruction is found in Proctor Trust Co. v. Neihart, 130 Kan. 698, 288   P. 574 (1930); United American State Bank & Trust Co. v.

Comment      Waiver is consensual in nature, but the intention may be inferred from conduct and the knowledge of   the waiver may be actual or constructive. City of Wamego v. L.R. Foy Constr. Co., 9 Kan. App. 2d 168, 675   P.2d 912, rev. denied 234 Kan. 1076 (1984). However, no inference of intent to waive can be drawn from   conduct of a party when there is unambiguous language in the contract stating a contrary intention. Postal   Savings & Loan Ass’n v. Freel, 10 Kan. App. 2d 286, 698 P.2d 382 (1984).      The manifestation of the intent to waive must be unequivocal and requires some distinct act or   inaction which is inconsistent with the intention to claim the right to performance. Patrons Mut. Ins. Ass’n   v. Union Gas System, Inc., 250 Kan. 722, 830 P.2d 35 (1992).      2020                   "      B. INSURANCE CONTRACTS      <h4><a name='124.31' href='124.31'>124.31</a></h4><p>POLICY TERMS      The obligation of the insurance company is governed by the provisions of   the policy. (Endorsements) (Applications attached) are a part of the policy.      Words used in an insurance policy are to be read and understood in their   ordinary and usual meaning (except those specially defined by the court in   these instructions).      Notes on Use      K.S.A. 40-420(2) and K.S.A. 40-2205(A) relate to the attachment of applications to life insurance   and accident and sickness insurance policies. See Notes on Use and Comment under PIK 4" , which   deals with applications for insurance. For other definitions see PIK 4"  and . Authority for   the instruction comes from Koehn v. Central National Ins. Co., 187 Kan. 192, 199, 354 P.2d 352 (1960),   which further holds that where words have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, they are to   be construed according to that meaning. The language of a policy, being that selected by the insurer and for   its benefit, must be clear and unambiguous, and any reasonable doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in   favor of the insured.      Comment      Insurance may be defined as any contract whereby one party promises for consideration to indemnify   the other against certain risks. State, ex rel., v. Anderson, 195 Kan. 649, 408 P.2d 864 (1965).     Courts will construe a contract of insurance as to uphold its validity if reasonably possible. Herrman   v. Folkerts, 202 Kan. 116, 120, 446 P.2d 834 (1968).      It is a generally accepted rule that insurance policies are to be construed in favor of the insured   and against the company. This rule, however, is to be invoked where there exist rational grounds for   construction of the policy. That is, the contract must contain provisions or language of doubtful, ambiguous   or conflicting meaning, as gathered from a natural interpretation of its language. Casey v. Aetna Casualty   & Surety Co., 205 Kan. 495, 498, 470 P.2d 821 (1970); Buchanan v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co.,   201 Kan. 666, 670, 443 P.2d 681 (1968); Ferguson v.

Insurance is a matter of contract and parties have the right to employ whatever terms they wish,   and the courts will not rewrite them, so long as those terms do not conflict with pertinent statutes or   public policy. Gibson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 213 Kan. 764, 770, 518 P.2d 422 (1974); Levier v.   Koppenheffer, 19 Kan. App. 2d 971, 879 P.2d 40 (1994).      A court, in construing an insurance policy, should consider the instrument as a whole and endeavor   to ascertain the intent of the parties from the language used, taking into account the situation of the parties,   the nature of the subject matter and the purpose to be accomplished. Mah v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 218   Kan. 583, 586, 545 P.2d 366 (1976).      2020      "       The construction and effect of a written contract of insurance is a matter of law to be determined by   the court. If the facts are admitted, then it is for the court to decide whether they come within the terms of   the policy. Mah v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 218 Kan. 583, 545 P.2d 366 (1976); Clark v. Prudential Ins.   Co., 204 Kan. 487, 490, 464 P.2d 253 (1970); Goforth v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., 202 Kan. 413, 416, 449 P.2d   477 (1969).

Notes on Use      Where the ambiguity in the policy presents a clear question of law, the court should construe the   contract and instruct the jury as to the rights of the parties. If the ambiguity presents an issue of fact, the   suggested instruction may be used to guide the jury in resolving that issue.      Comment      If an ambiguity is presented as an issue of fact in an insurance contract, an instruction similar to this   one should be given. See Snodgrass v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 15 Kan. App. 2d 153, 157, 804 P.2d   1012, rev. denied 248 Kan. 997 (1991).      An insurance company prepares its own policies and is responsible for any proper consequences   of not making the policy clear and understandable. Where an ambiguity exists in the policy, the rule of   construction in favor of the policyholder applies. Leiker v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 193   Kan. 630, 396 P.2d 264 (1964); Alliance Life Ins. Co. v. Ulysses Volunteer Fireman's Relief Assn., 215 Kan.   937, 529 P.2d 171 (1974); Fancher v.

The test to be applied in determining the intention of the parties to an insurance contract is not   what the insurer intended the policy to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the insured   would understand it to mean. Colfax v. Johnson, 270 Kan. 7, 11, 11 P.3d 1171 (2000). The intention of the   parties is evidenced by the language in the contract. Crescent Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 20 Kan.   App. 2d 428, 888 P.2d 869 (1995). In interpreting an insurance policy, the court should consider the policy   as a whole and determine the intent of the parties from the language of the instrument while taking into   account the situation of the parties, nature of the subject matter, and purpose to be accomplished. Levier v.   Koppenheffer, 19 Kan. App. 2d 971, 879 P.2d 40 (1994); Mah v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 218 Kan. 583,   545 P.2d 366 (1976).      If the insurer intends to limit or restrict coverage in the policy, it must use clear and unambiguous   language; otherwise, the policy will be liberally construed in favor of the insured. Atlantic Avenue Associates   v. Central Solutions, Inc., 29 Kan. App. 2d 169, 172, 24 P.3d 188 (2001).      To be ambiguous, the contract must contain provisions or language of doubtful or conflicting   meaning, as gleaned from a natural interpretation of its language. Ambiguity in a written contract does   not appear until the application of pertinent rules of interpretation to the face of the instrument leaves it   uncertain which one of two or more meanings is the proper meaning.

Farmers & Bankers Life Ins. Co., 163 Kan.   277, 181 P.2d 520 (1947). Likewise, if there is an irreconcilable conflict between the printed policy and   handwritten portions, preference should be given to the handwritten portions when construing the policy.   Lightner v. Centennial Life Ins. Co., 242 Kan. 29, 744 P.2d 840 (1987).     Where a restrictive endorsement attached to an insurance policy and the issuance of the insurance   policy are a part of the same transaction, and the restriction was agreed to in order to induce the issuance   of the policy, there was adequate consideration for the acceptance of the restrictive endorsement. Avery v.   Nelson, 205 Kan. 311, 469 P.2d 349 (1970).

Delay in Acting on Application      After an applicant makes an application and pays the initial premium,   the company has a reasonable time to act on the application. It may accept the   application and premium and issue a policy, or it may reject the application,   return the premium, and notify the applicant that it declines to issue a policy.   If it does not return the premium and notify the applicant within a reasonable   time, then it becomes bound to the same extent as though it had accepted the   application and premium and had written the insurance requested. Whether   the defendant acted within a reasonable time is for you to determine.      B. Conflicts between Application and Policy      The application and the policy are to be considered as parts of a single   contract of insurance.      When there is a conflict between typewritten portions of the application,   which forms a part of the policy, and certain printed portions of the policy,   the application portions are controlling.

When the conditional receipt for insurance states unequivocally and   clearly that there is no insurance unless the policy is delivered within a specified time, the contract expires   by its own terms, without notice, unless the policy is delivered. Thomas v. Thomas, 250 Kan. 235, 824 P.2d   971 (1992).     One who seeks to rescind a contract on grounds of fraud must do so with reasonable promptness after   discovery of the fraud. Moore v. Farm & Ranch Life Ins. Co., 211 Kan. 10, 11, 505 P.2d 666 (1973).     A policy that is withdrawn or recalled before it becomes effective does not require notice of   cancellation. Marker v. Preferred Fire Ins. Co., 211 Kan. 427, 437, 506 P.2d 1163 (1973).                              "      <h4><a name='124.36' href='124.36'>124.36</a></h4><p>SUBROGATION      A.

B. Conventional Subrogation—Ceollision Loss      (Name of insurance company) was obligated under a policy of   insurance to pay for (repairs to) the ( ) vehicle, and it has done so.

The acts or failure to act of the driver of the ( ) vehicle are to be   considered by you as the acts or failure to act of (name of insurance   company). (The insurance company can recover in this case only if the driver of   the [ | vehicle could recover.)      Notes on Use      Instruction A is designed for use where the subrogation arises by operation of law. Instruction B is   designed for use where an automobile insurance carrier has paid a collision loss, has acquired the rights of   subrogation by contract under the policy, and brings the action in its own name.     Where the subrogee insurance company properly brings the action in the name of the subrogor, this   instruction should not be used. The case should be tried and the jury instructed as though the insured were   the sole party in interest without mention of the interest of the insurer. See El/saesser v. Mid-Continent   Casualty Co., 195 Kan. 117, 119, 403 P.2d 185 (1965).      2020      "      2020      It is the duty of the court to determine whether under the facts a party is entitled to be subrogated;   once the court makes that determination, then the court must instruct the jury as to how the doctrine   applies.     The implications of K.S.A. 60-2 13(d) should be examined carefully with reference to any counterclaim   that may exist against a subrogor in favor of a third person.      Comment      “ ‘Subrogation’ ... is a substitution of persons by which another person succeeds to the rights of a   creditor, or similar claimant, in relation to the debt or claim ... [Subrogation] is of two kinds, ‘legal’ and   ‘conventional.’ The former is grounded in equity and arises by operation of law, which gives to a third   person who has been compelled to pay a remedy as against one who, in justice, ought to pay. Some writers   have treated it as in the nature of an equitable assignment. Ordinarily when the term is used without   qualification ‘legal’ subrogation is meant. ‘Conventional’ subrogation is founded upon contract, express or   implied.” New York Ins. Co. v. Tice, 159 Kan. 176, 181, 152 P.2d 836 (1944), overruled on other grounds   Ellis Canning Co. v. International Harvester Co., 174 Kan. 357, 255 P.2d 658 (1953). In the Tice case,   the court summarizes the situations giving rise to conventional subrogation, and notes which party should   bring the action.      A subrogee may assert any right of the subrogor against the party primarily responsible, including a   right sounding in contract. Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Shepherd-Vineyard Motors, 189 Kan. 525,   370 P.2d 388 (1962).      When an employer is compelled to pay damages as the result of negligent acts of his employee,   under the doctrine of subrogation he immediately becomes entitled to full indemnity against the employee,   or against his estate, and his insurer. Jacobson v. Parrill, 186 Kan. 467, 475, 351 P.2d 194 (1960); Graham   v. Barber, 192 Kan. 554, 558, 390 P.2d 23 (1964).      The rights of the insurer against the wrongdoer cannot rise higher than the rights of the insured   against the latter, because the insurer as subrogee, in contemplation of law, stands in the place of the insured   and succeeds to whatever rights he may have in the matter. Any defense which a wrongdoer has against   the insured is good against the insurer subrogated to the rights of the insured. 44 Am. Jur. 2d, Insurance §§   195; Patrons Mut. Ins. Ass’n. v. Union Gas Systems, 250 Kan. 722, 830 P.2d 35 (1992).      Where a loss is covered partially by insurance, the insured is the real party in interest to bring suit for   the entire loss. The insured holds in trust for the insurer the part of the recovery paid by the insurer. Cullen   v. Atchison, T. & S. F Rly Co., 211 Kan. 368, 374, 507 P.2d 353 (1973); J.C. Livestock Sales, Inc. v. Schoof,   208 Kan. 289, 491 P.2d 560 (1971); Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Shawnee State Bank, 13 Kan.   App. 2d 182, 766 P.2d 191 (1989).      The right of subrogation of an insurer arises by operation of law without regard to whether there is   a provision in the insurance policy or any writing declaring the right. It is a creature of equity and does not   spring from contract. New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 212 Kan. 456, 457, 510 P.2d   1194 (1973). See also Oetinger v. Polson, 20 Kan. App. 2d 255, 885 P.2d 1274 (1995).      When an insurer has fully satisfied a claim of its insured and thereby becomes subrogated to the   rights of the insured, it alone becomes the real party in interest. Appalchian Ins. Co. of Providence v. Betts,   213 Kan. 609, 610, 518 P.2d 385 (1974).      A subrogation agreement is ineffective to confer a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors   where it would operate to thwart the law of Kansas, which prohibits such contribution. American States Ins.   Co. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 218 Kan. 563, 545 P.2d 399 (1976).     Mere anticipation of a claim does not permit an insurer to become subrogated to its insured’s rights.      The insurer must make a payment to the insured or suffer a judgment requiring payment to its insured   before subrogation takes effect. Burke v. Schroth, 4 Kan. App. 2d 13, 601 P.2d 1172 (1979).                  "      <h4><a name='124.37' href='124.37'>124.37</a></h4><p>PROOF OF LOSS—WAIVER      When an insurance policy requires the insured to provide a written Proof   of Loss to the insurer within (insert number) days after the loss, if   the insured fails to furnish such proof, the insured cannot recover unless the   insurer waived the furnishing of a Proof of Loss.      The insurer waived the furnishing of a Proof of Loss if: (insert   one or more of the following)      e (it denied liability on grounds other than failure to furnish   Proof of Loss.)     e (it attempted to make settlement with the insured.)     e (it offered to pay all or part of the loss.)     e (its general agent orally granted an extension of time to furnish   Proof of Loss.)     e (it retained an incomplete Proof of Loss for an unreasonable   period of time without objection.)     e (it failed to furnish Proof of Loss forms to the insured within   ten days after receiving notice of the loss.)      Notes on Use      K.S.A. 40-924 requires the furnishing of Proof of Loss forms by insurance companies in fire or   tornado cases within 10 days after receiving notice, and provides that upon failure to furnish such forms,   the failure of the insured to make Proof of Loss shall be no defense.      K.S.A. 40-2203(A)(7) provides a uniform policy provision for Proof of Loss in policies of accident   and sickness insurance.      Comment      The insured has a duty to give notice to his company of his loss and of the fact that he is making a   claim under his policy, before the company is obligated to take action. Sloan v. Employers Casualty Ins.   Co., 214 Kan. 443, 445, 521 P.2d 249 (1974).      Where the policy requires it, Proof of Loss must be given or facts constituting a waiver must be   shown. A party asserting waiver of the furnishing of Proof of Loss has the burden of proof on that issue.   Lyon v. Kansas City Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 176 Kan. 411, 271 P.2d 291 (1954).      Insured has provided reasonable proof of loss when the insurer is provided with a bill which shows a   clear relation to a covered loss. A clear relation exists when reasonable minds would conclude that there is a   substantial likelihood that the loss evinced by the bill bears a logical connection to a covered loss. Hephner   v. Traders Ins. Co., 254 Kan. 226, 864 P.2d 674 (1993); Dibassie v. American Standard Ins. Co., 8 Kan.   App. 2d 515, 661 P.2d 812, (1983).      In the absence of fraud or the elements of estoppel, proofs of loss, injury, or death, furnished by an   insured or beneficiary, are not conclusive upon the insured or beneficiary as to the cause of the loss, injury,       2020      "      2020      or death or as to the amount of the loss, but may be shown by other evidence to be erroneous or incomplete   or to be the result of mistake, misfortune, or inadvertence. Wildey v. Sheppard, 61 Kan. 351, 59 P. 651   (1900); Gass v. Casualty Co., 113 Kan. 610, 214 P. 1115 (1923); Smith v. Prudential Ins. Co., 136 Kan. 120,   12 P.2d 793 (1932).     “In order to establish the waiver of a legal right there must be a clear, unequivocal and decisive act   of the party showing such a purpose or acts amounting to an estoppel on his part.” Lyon v. Kansas City Fire   & Marine Ins. Co., 176 Kan. 411, 414, 271 P.2d 291 (1954).     As used in insurance law, a waiver is often defined as an intentional, voluntary relinquishment of a   known right. Estoppel is defined as the misleading of a party entitled to rely on the acts or statements in   question, as a consequence of which he changes his position to his detriment.     “Tt is the general rule that where an insurer, with knowledge of facts warranting forfeiture, enters   into negotiations after loss which recognize continued validity of the policy and induce the insured to incur   trouble or expense under the belief the loss will be paid, the forfeiture is waived.” Marett v. World Fire &   Ins. Co., 160 Kan. 125, 160 P.2d 664 (1945).     When the insured supplies documentation regarding the amount of loss and the insurer pays the      amount documented, the insured cannot recover on an action claiming underpayment as a result of error.

SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE CONTRACTS      <h4><a name='124.41' href='124.41'>124.41</a></h4><p>DEFINITIONS      “Accident” means an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event, usually   of an afflictive or unfortunate character, and often, but not necessarily,   accompanied by a manifestation of force.      “Active” means in a state of action, progress, change or motion.      “Bodily injury” means injury sustained to the person through external   and accidental means, as opposed to disease.      “Dormant” means in a state of rest, inactivity, inoperativeness or   quiescence.      A person is incapable of “engaging in any gainful occupation” if (he) (she)   is unable to work with reasonable continuity in (his) (her) usual occupation   or in such occupation as (he) (she) is physically and mentally qualified for,   and to perform the essential duties incident thereto. “Engaging in a gainful   occupation” imports a continuing earning capacity upon which one can rely   to a substantial degree for a livelihood. It is not the doing of odd jobs of a   comparatively trifling nature.      “Illness” refers to sickness, infection, disease, or a disorder of health, as   differentiated from bodily injury caused by external force.      “A totally disabled person” is a person who because of mental or physical   incapacity is for all practical purposes unable to engage in any type of gainful   employment for which (he) (she) normally would have been qualified.      “Other insurance” means insurance in addition to that covered by the   policy under consideration.

Comment      As authority for the instruction, see Williams v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., 195 Kan. 579, 408 P.2d   631 (1965); Williams v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., 200 Kan. 51, 55, 434 P.2d 765 (1967).     It is the general rule that the origin or inception of a sickness or disease, within the meaning of   a health or accident policy requiring that sickness and disease be contracted after the effective date of   the policy, is that point in time when the disease becomes manifest or active or when there is a distinct   symptom or condition from which one learned in medicine can diagnose the disease. Southards v. Central   Plains Ins. Co., 201 Kan. 499, 501, 441 P.2d 808 (1968).     Knowledge of the condition by one afflicted with disease is not essential to establish the existence or   date of origin of the disease. Zd, 201 Kan. at 502.     A dormant disease is one which is quiescent, passive, resting, or static. Boring v. Haynes, 209 Kan.   413, 421, 496 P.2d 1385 (1972).

FIRE, HAIL AND WINDSTORM INSURANCE CONTRACTS   <h4><a name='124.45' href='124.45'>124.45</a></h4><p>DEFINITIONS      “Fire” is the evolution of visible light and heat in the burning of ignited   material, with either slow or rapid combustion.      “Windstorm” is a climatic condition in which there is wind of   extraordinary or unusual violence, either with or without rain.      Notes on Use      The definitions in this instruction are intended for use only when the terms are not defined in the   policy. The definitions are separable and only those applicable should be used.      Comment      Definitions contained within the policy control.     The word “fire” as used in a policy, in the absence of language showing a contrary intention, is to be   given its ordinary meaning, which includes the idea of visible heat or light. Wool, destroyed by spontaneous   combustion without visible flame or glow, was not destroyed by fire according to Western Woolen Mill   Co. v. Northern Assur. Co., 139 F. 637 (8" Cir. 1905), cert. denied 199 U.S. 608, 26 S. Ct. 750, 50 L. Ed.   331 (1905). Fire may be a burning by slow or a burning by rapid combustion, and if the policy makes no   distinction between them, a loss by either is covered by its general terms. Spontaneous combustion, if not   expressly excluded, is included. 43 Am. Jur. 2d, Insurance § 478.     Fire insurance policies cover losses from “hostile” fires, not losses from “friendly” fires. Youse v.   Employers Fire Ins. Co., 172 Kan. 111, 238 P.2d 472 (1951); McGraw v. Home Ins. Co., 93 Kan. 482, 144   P. 821 (1914).     A policy prohibition against increasing the risk applies to anything done by the insured, but does   not apply to things done by a third person, on adjoining property, and of which the insured may have been   unaware. German Ins. Co. v. Wright, 6 Kan.App. 611, 49 P. 704 (1897).     Aclause making a fire insurance policy payable to named insureds as their interest may appear refers   to the interests existing at the time of the loss. New Hampshire Ins. Co. v.

Notes on Use      The Kansas “valued policy law,” K.S.A. 40-905, provides:     Whenever any policy of insurance shall be written to insure any improvements upon real property   in this state against loss by fire, tornado or lightning, and the property insured shall be wholly destroyed,   without criminal fault on the part of the insured or his assigns, the amount of insurance written in such   policy shall be taken conclusively to be the true value of the property insured, and the true amount of   loss and measure of damages, and the payment of money as a premium for insurance shall be prima facie   evidence that the party paying such insurance is the owner of the property insured.     An insurance company may set out fraud in obtaining the policy as a defense to a lawsuit based on   the policy.     For Measure of Damage instructions when the property is not wholly destroyed, see PIK 4"    and  (Personal Property), PIK 4"  and  (Real Estate), and PIK 4"  (Actual Cash   Value).      Comment      Whether or not a building is wholly destroyed is a question for the trier of facts. For authority for the   instruction, see McKenzie v. Fidelity-Phoenix Fire Ins. Co., 133 Kan. 721, 3 P.2d 477 (1931); Liverpool &   London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Heckman, 64 Kan. 388, 67 P. 879 (1902).     “Total loss” and “wholly destroyed,” when applied to insurance, are equivalents. “Total loss” does   not mean the complete annihilation or extinction of the property insured, and the term does not mean that   the portion of the property remaining after loss has no value for any purpose whatever. Kinzer v. National   Mut. Ins. Co., 88 Kan. 93, 127 P. 762 (1912); Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Heckman, 64 Kan.   388, 67 P. 879 (1902). Although some portion of the building may remain after a casualty, yet if such   portion cannot be reasonably used to advantage in the reconstruction of the building, or will not, for some   purpose, bring more money than sufficient to remove the ruins, the building is, in contemplation of the   law, a “total loss” or “wholly destroyed.” This may be described as a “constructive total loss” if the cost of   restoring the building to its insured use is more than the amount of the policy. Liverpool & London & Globe   Ins. Co. v. Heckman, 64 Kan. 388, 67 P. 879 (1902).

Notes on Use      The quotation in the parenthesis states the usual policy provision relating to “actual cash value.” A   direct quotation from the policy should be used.     See PIK 4"  for definition of market value; PIK 4"  and  for measure of damage   instruction relating to property; and PIK 4"  relating to property having no market value.      Comment      An “actual cash value” provision in a fire insurance policy covering personal property (wheat) was   taken to mean market price less hauling in Lambert v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 178 Kan. 533, 289   P.2d 1057 (1955).     When applied to a partial loss, the term “actual cash value” in a homeowner’s policy means repair   without a reduction for depreciation for the materials used unless specific policy provisions or a course   of dealing indicate otherwise.

Street, 148 Kan. 587, 83 P.2d 793 (1938).      An oral contract for employment not to be performed within one year from the making thereof may   be unenforceable under the statute of frauds, K.S.A. 33-106. Part performance of such a contract does not   take it out of the statute, since the equitable doctrine of part performance applies only to land contracts.   Manning v. Woods, 187 Kan. 418, 422, 357 P.2d 757 (1960). But if a party has completed his performance,   and nothing remains to be done but to pay him, the contract is enforceable. Richard v. Kilborn, 150 Kan.   579, 584, 95 P.2d 545 (1939); Kinser v. Bennett, Admr., 163 Kan. 725, 728, 186 P.2d 284 (1947). A contract   to employ for life, being possible of execution within a year, is enforceable and not within the statute of   frauds. Pierson v. Kingman Milling Co., 91 Kan. 775, 778, 139 P. 394 (1914), reh. denied 92 Kan. 468, 140   P. 1033 (1914). Likewise, a contract of hiring which fixes no definite time for its termination is not within   the statute. Talbott v. Gaty, 171 Kan. 136, 141, 231 P.2d 202 (1951).     A person is not an employee by virtue of the fact that he does work or performs services for another   merely as a favor. St. Aubyn v. Thogmartin, 206 Kan. 62, 67, 476 P.2d 248 (1970).     When an employee is made aware of a company policy that is part of the terms of the employment   contract, the employee will be held to those terms. Sweet v. Stormont Vail Regional Medical Center, 231   Kan. 604, 647 P.2d 1274 (1982).                              <h4><a name='124.52' href='124.52'>124.52</a></h4><p>DISCHARGE OF EMPLOYEE      Where there is a contract of employment fixing a definite term of service   between the parties, the employer may for legal cause discharge the employee   (or terminate the employment relationship) prior to the expiration of the agreed   term.      An employer has legal cause to dismiss an employee during the agreed   term of employment if the employee (insert one or more of the   following)      performs (his) (her) contractual obligation in such a way as   to deprive the employer of an essential part of the performance   for which the employer bargained; or     fails to perform (his) (her) duties with competency, efficiency,   honesty, and with faithfulness to (his) (her) employer’s interests.   [An employee is bound to exercise good faith toward (his) (her)   employer.

Under such a contract,   the employee has no cause of action for breach of contract if he is discharged. Exceptions are contracts for   definite terms or with specific restraints on termination, and statutes, lawful administrative regulations, or   collective bargaining agreements between employer and employees regulating termination. May v. Santa   Fe Trail Transportation Co., 189 Kan. 419, 370 P.2d 390 (1962).

Notes on Use      Authority for the instruction is found in Johnson v. National Beef Packing Co., 220 Kan. 52, 551   P.2d 779 (1976). In Johnson the court set forth the general rule that in the absence of a contract, express or   implied, between an employee and his employer covering the duration of employment, the employment is   terminable at the will of either party.     The instruction should be given whenever there is an issue concerning an employment-at-will   contract.      Comment      Under the American common law, an employer may discharge his at-will employee for good cause,   for no cause, or even for wrong cause, without incurring liability to the employee for wrongful discharge.   Morriss v. Coleman Co., 241 Kan. 501, 508, 738 P.2d 841 (1987); Kansas Baptist Convention v. Mesa   Operating Limited Partnership, 253 Kan. 717, 864 P.2d 204 (1993).     The mere fact that an employee has not been previously terminated under written contractual   employment-at-will provisions does not create an implied contract for continuing employment. Dickens v.   Snodgrass, Dunlap & Co., 255 Kan. 164, 872 P.2d 252 (1994).     In St. Catherine Hospital of Garden City v. Rodriguez, 25 Kan. App. 2d 763, 971 P.2d 754 (1998), the   court held that when an agreement provides for termination by either party, without cause, by the giving of   a written notice within a specific time and the agreement has been terminated precisely as required by its   terms, the implied duties of good faith and fair dealing do not arise.                              <h4><a name='124.54' href='124.54'>124.54</a></h4><p>DISCHARGE OF EMPLOYEE—MEASURE OF DAMAGES      If you find for the plaintiff, then you should award such sum as you believe   will fairly and justly compensate (him) (her) for the damages you believe (he)   (she) sustained as a direct result of the breach of the employment contract by   the defendant.      In determining plaintiff’s damages, you should consider any of the   following elements that you find were a direct result of the breach:      [List here the elements of damage claimed by the plaintiff and supported   by the evidence.]      The total amount of your verdict may not exceed the sum of $ 3   the amount of plaintiff’s claim.      Notes on Use      The court should determine the elements of damage that are properly recoverable as a matter of law,   and list them in the instruction. The need for this instruction is stated in Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208   Kan. 909, 926, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972).      Comment      An employee who has been wrongfully discharged has two separate remedies to pursue. He may   treat the contract as rescinded and sue in quantum meruit for the value of his services actually rendered,   or bring an action for breach of contract for damages that are the natural and direct result of the breach.   See 27 Am. Jur. 2d, Employment Relationship § 40; Challis v. Hartloff, 136 Kan. 823, 827, 18 P.2d 199   (1933). In Rench v. Hayes Equipment Mfg. Co., 134 Kan. 865, 8 P.2d 346 (1932), the plaintiff was allowed   to recover the amount of salary he lost between the time of wrongful discharge and the date of his new   employment, and that amount he reasonably expended in searching for new employment. He was not   allowed the expenses for coming to and from Wisconsin, his home, to his place of employment. See also   Masterson v. Boliden-Allis, Inc., 19 Kan. App. 2d 23, 865 P.2d 1031 (1993).     A liquidated damages clause is valid and enforceable, even though phrased in language of penalty,   if the amount stipulated is conscionable and the nature of the transaction is such that the amount of actual   damages resulting from default would not be easily determined. U.S.D. No. 315 v. DeWerff, 6 Kan. App. 2d   77, 626 P.2d 1206 (1981).     “[A] common-law retaliation claim may be premised on any employment action that is materially   adverse to a reasonable employee, i.e., ‘harmful to the point that [it] could well dissuade a reasonable   worker from’ exercising the worker’s rights under the Civil Service Act.” Hill v. State 310 Kan. 490, 505,   448 P.3d 457 (2019), relying on Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S. Ct.   2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). The Kansas Supreme Court held that Hill could “premise a claim for relief   on an employment action short of firing him, reducing his wages or benefits, or diminishing his workplace   status.” 310 Kan. at 505.

It is, therefore, distinguishable from an employment-at-will   contract.      The understanding and intent of the parties may be ascertained from   several factors which include: (Insert applicable options)      e written or oral negotiations;      e the conduct of the parties from the commencement of the   employment relationship;      e the usage of the business;      e the situation and objective of the parties giving rise to the   relationship;      e the nature of the employment;      e any other circumstances surrounding the employment   relationship that would tend to explain or make clear the   intention of the parties.

The authority for the standard of just cause is Morriss v. Coleman Co., 241 Kan. 501, , 738   P.2d 841 (1987).      Comment      A contract implied-in-fact arises from facts and circumstances showing mutual intent to contract.   Mai v. Youtsey, 231 Kan. 419, 422, 646 P.2d 475 (1982). In an implied contract, one or more of the terms   and conditions are implied from the conduct of the parties. See Williams v. Jones, 105 Kan. 282, 182 P. 391   (1919).     Implied-in-fact contracts need not be formally or explicitly stated in words. Morriss v. Coleman Co.,   241 Kan. 501, 513, 738 P.2d 841 (1987); Johnson v. National Beef Packing Co., 220 Kan. 52, 551 P.2d   779 (1976); Allegri v. Providence-St. Margaret Health Center, 9 Kan. App. 2d 659, 684 P.2d 1031 (1984).   Evidence establishing discharge for cause coupled with an absence of evidence of an implied employment   contract precluded recovery on a breach of contract claim. Batt v. Globe Engineering Co., 13 Kan. App.   2d 500, 774 P.2d 371 (1989) (complete lack of evidence concerning employer’s intentions on issuing   employment policy).                              "      An employment manual that is only a unilateral expression of company policy and is not bargained   for cannot be the sole basis of an implied employment contract. Rouse v.

Smith, 853 F.2d 789 (10" Cir. 1988) (implied contract not created   by employer’s disciplinary letter stating that the employee would be terminated for any further serious   misconduct). The mere fact that an employee has not been previously terminated under written contractual   employment-at-will provisions does not create an implied contract for continuing employment. Dickens v.   Snodgrass, Dunlap & Co., 255 Kan. 164, 872 P.2d 252 (1994).     In Wilkinson v. Shoney 5, Inc., 269 Kan. 194, 4 P.3d 1149 (2000), the court held that a disclaimer in   an employer’s manual is not determinative as a matter of law on the issue of whether there is an implied   contract of employment where the disclaimer is expressly or impliedly contradicted by other provisions   in the manual, statements made by the employer, or other documents. The court referred to all the factors   contained in PIK 3d  [now PIK 4" ] as being proper for a jury to consider in determining the   intent of the parties.     The determination of whether an implied-in-fact contract exists is a question of fact for the jury   to decide. The intent of the parties need not be established by direct proof but can be shown by acts,   circumstances, and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. Stover v. Superior Industries Int’l, Inc., 29   Kan. App. 2d 235, , 29 P.3d 967, rev. denied 270 Kan. 903 (2000). However, the determination of   whether an implied-in-fact employment contract exists is not a question of fact for the jury to decide when   the employee only presents evidence of his or her unilateral expectations of continued employment. If the   employee cannot provide evidence beyond a unilateral expectation of employment, summary judgment   may be appropriate. /nscho v. Exide Corp., 29 Kan.

App. 2d 659, 664, 684   P.2d 1031 (1984). The court should first determine as a matter of law whether a public policy prohibits   the actions alleged by the plaintiff and, if found, instruct the jury that if they find that the facts support the   plaintiff’s theory of retaliation, such action is prohibited by said policy and plaintiff may recover. The need   for this prerequisite finding is suggested in Coleman v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 242 Kan. 804, 808, 752 P.2d   645 (1988).     When using bullet number 4 of the instruction, whenever the word “retaliatory” is used it should be   replaced with the word “wrongful.”     Claimants are required to prove a claim for retaliatory discharge by clear and convincing evidence.

Comment      Termination of an employee in retaliation for the good faith reporting of a serious infraction of   the law by a co-worker or an employer to either company management or law enforcement officials   (“whistleblowing”) is an actionable tort. Palmer v. Brown, 242 Kan. 893, 752 P.2d 685 (1988). See also   Moyer v. Allen Freight Lines, Inc., 20 Kan. App. 2d 203, 885 P.2d 391 (1994), where the dissent contends   that the language in Palmer recognizing a cause of action of retaliatory discharge for “internal whistle   blowing” is mere dicta.

Termination of an employee in retaliation for supporting equal employment opportunities or opposing   racial discrimination, activities that are protected by the civil rights statute, is an actionable tort. Harris v.   First Nat. Bank of Hutchinson, Kan., 680 F. Supp. 1489 (D. Kan. 1987).     Termination of a public employee for exercising protected First Amendment rights (writing to   the Kansas Attorney General about matters concerning the police department) entitles one to monetary   damages. Wulf v. City of Wichita, 644 F. Supp. 1211 (D. Kan. 1986); Riddle v. City of Ottawa, 12 Kan.   App. 2d 714, 754 P.2d 465 (1988) (employee stated cause of action by alleging suspension in retaliation   for exercise of free speech). In such a case, the trial court must first determine whether the employee’s   speech can be characterized as addressing a matter of public concern. If so, the court must then balance   the interest of the employee against the interest of the employer in effectively and efficiently fulfilling its   responsibilities to the public. If the employee’s claims survive these threshold determinations by the court,   the employee’s case should be submitted to a jury properly instructed on the claims presented. Dennis v.   Ruskowitz, 19 Kan. App. 2d 515, 873 P.2d 199 (1994).     In a case involving whistle blowing and free speech retaliatory discharge claims by a terminated   attorney for a state agency, the court found the attorney used poor judgment and did not take steps that a   reasonably prudent attorney would have taken prior to reporting suspected violations to an outside federal   agency, thus destroying the attorney’s effectiveness with the state agency. When close working relationships   (such as an attorney-client relationship) are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of   deference to the employer’s judgment is appropriate. In this case, the governmental interest prevailed over   any First Amendment rights that may have been involved. Crandon v. State, 257 Kan. 727, 897 P.2d 92   (1995).     The internal loan policies, guidelines, or underwriting standards of a savings & loan association are   not “rules, regulations, or the law pertaining to the public health, safety and the general welfare,” and being   discharged for reporting a violation thereof cannot be the basis for a retaliatory discharge claim. Herman v.   Western Financial Corp., 254 Kan. 870, 869 P.2d 696 (1994).     In Brigham v. Dillon Companies, Inc., 262 Kan. 12, 935 P.2d 1054 (1997), the Kansas Supreme   Court recognized the tort of retaliatory demotion concluding that such an action is a logical and necessary   extension of the tort of retaliatory discharge.

Comment      Anable buyer is one with the financial capability to buy. A buyer is not willing if the buyer unjustifiably   refuses or is financially unable to perform at the time of the closing. Moody Investments, Inc. v. Baldwin, 12   Kan. App. 2d 686, 754 P.2d 810 (1988).     A real estate broker, to bring and maintain an action, has the burden of proving that, at the time the   cause of action arose, he was duly licensed. K.S.A. 58-3019; Deines v. Frevert, 170 Kan. 278, 224 P.2d   1023 (1950).     Where a broker has an exclusive right to sell for a definite term and fails to procure a purchaser, and   the owner during the term sells through a second broker, the first broker is not entitled to a commission,   but he is entitled to recover damages for breach of contract. Isern v. Gordon, 127 Kan. 296, 273 P. 435   (1929).     The general rule is that a real estate broker, having either an exclusive or a general listing, is entitled   to a commission only when he produces a buyer who is ready, able, and willing to purchase upon terms   proffered by or acceptable to his principal. Jsern v. Gordon, 127 Kan. 296, 273 P. 435 (1929); Hiniger v.   Judy, 194 Kan. 155, 398 P.2d 305 (1965); Graber v. Tennant, 173 Kan. 577, 250 P.2d 816 (1952); Martin   v. Weidman, 199 Kan. 716, 433 P.2d 459 (1967). This is true although the sale is not consummated. The   refusal of the seller to complete the sale will not defeat the agent’s right to a commission. Green v. Fist,   89 Kan. 536, 132 P. 179 (1913). It is not necessary that the broker handle all of the details. It is sufficient   if he procures the buyer and lets the principal make the sale. Where, however, the broker procures a buyer   who takes only an option, which is never exercised, the broker is not entitled to a commission. Hedges v.   Keas, 180 Kan. 540, 306 P.2d 181, modified on other grounds and reh. denied, 181 Kan. 503, 313 P.2d 264   (1957). The transfer of title is not required for a complete sale entitling the broker to a commission.     If a broker is otherwise entitled to a commission, the seller cannot defeat that right by closing the   deal himself. The question of whether a broker is the “efficient and procuring cause of a consummated      2020      "      2020      deal” is one to be determined by the trier of facts in the light of all of the circumstances.

BAILMENTS      <h4><a name='124.71' href='124.71'>124.71</a></h4><p>DEFINITION OF BAILMENT      A bailment is the (delivery and acceptance) (obtaining of possession) of   personal property for a particular purpose without a transfer of ownership.      The “Bailor” is the person who (delivers) (owns) the property.      The “Bailee” is the person who (receives) (obtains) possession of the   property.      [In this case (insert name) (is the bailor) (claims that [he] [she] is   the bailor) and (insert name) (is the bailee) (claims that [he] [she] is the   bailee)|      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given in all cases involving a bailment claim. Omit phrases in parenthesis   that are not applicable. The words or phrases “obtaining of possession,” “owns,” and “obtains” should be   used when the claim involves a constructive bailment, i.e., in instances where the bailee obtains possession   of personal property without a prior understanding with the bailor. If there is an issue concerning the claim   of being the bailor or the bailee, the applicable parenthesis in the bracketed paragraph should be given.     This instruction is framed under common law concepts of bailment. Therefore, if the claim involves   subject matter that has been codified by the Uniform Commercial Code, the instruction should be modified   accordingly.      Comment      Authority for the instruction is found in Schoonover v. Igleheart Bros., 163 Kan. 689, 186 P.2d 109   (1947), and M. Bruenger & Co., Inc. v. Dodge City Truck Stop, Inc., 234 Kan. 682, 675 P.2d 864 (1984). In   Schoonover, the Kansas Supreme Court defined bailments as:     “[A] delivery of personalty for some particular purpose, or on mere deposit, upon a   contract, express or implied, that after the purpose has been fulfilled it shall be redelivered   to the person who delivered it, or otherwise dealt with according to his directions, or   kept until he reclaims it, as the case may be.” 163 Kan. at 693 (quoting from 8 C.J.S.,   Bailments, § 1).     This is the traditional definition which treats the bailment transaction as one arising out of contract.   However, Professor Williston in his treatise on contracts defines bailments more broadly “as the rightful   possession of goods by one who is not the owner.” 9 Williston on Contracts (3d ed.) p 1030. This view,   which is supported by other learned authors, is based on the reality that many bailments are not rounded on   contract. The typical reference being constructive bailments where a bailee obtains possession of personal   property without an understanding with the bailor. In such cases the contract elements of mutual assent and                              "      consideration are lacking. For an excellent discussion of the two views see Brown and Raushenbush, Law   of Personal Property (3d ed.) § 10.1.     A bailment is different from a sale in that in a sale the title to the property passes to the purchaser,   whereas in a bailment title remains in the bailor. Kansas Flour Mills Co. v. Harper County Comm’rs, 124   Kan. 312, 259 P. 795 (1927); Bank v. McIntosh, 72 Kan. 603, 84 P. 535 (1906).     A trust is distinguished from a bailment in that the trustee acquires legal title to the trust res for the   purpose of performing his duties. A bailee, on the other hand, has only possession of the property. See 8   Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments § 29.     A bailee is estopped from denying the bailor’s title to property. See Thompson v. Williams, 30 Kan.   114, 1 P. 47 (1883).      2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.72' href='124.72'>124.72</a></h4><p>BAILMENT—DUTY OF CARE BY BAILEE      When the purpose of the bailment has been fulfilled, a bailee has the duty   to /exercise ordinary care in safeguarding the bailor’s property while in (his)   (her) care] [to return the property to the bailor] [to return the property to the   bailor in as good as condition as received, reasonable wear and tear excepted].   A breach of (this duty) (these duties) constitutes negligence.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given in all bailment claims concerning the negligence of the bailee. This   includes the three traditional classes of bailments, namely: sole benefit of the bailee, sole benefit of the   bailor, and mutual benefit for both. The bracketed words should be given when applicable. In addition, PIK   4 , Negligence Defined, should be given.      Comment      Authority for this instruction is Maddock v. Riggs, 106 Kan. 808, 190 P. 12 (1920). In Maddock, the   Kansas Supreme Court stated:      “The modern theory, adopted by many courts, is, that there are no degrees of care   or of negligence; that negligence is in all cases the same thing, namely, the absence of   due care. ‘The tendency of modern judicial opinion is adverse to the distinction between   gross and ordinary negligence.’ [Citation omitted].      “TW ]hether he exercised due care in view of all the circumstances, it is apparent that the   so-called distinction between slight, ordinary and gross negligence over which courts   have quibbled for a hundred years can furnish no assistance. Of course, the law did   not impose upon him the responsibility of an insurer, nor require of him the exercise of   anything unreasonable... “ 106 Kan. at 816.     The decision in Maddock confronts a problem that has plagued the courts for years over the   classification of bailments and the duty of care of a bailee over bailed property. The early common law   recognized six classifications along with six duties of care. This scheme is attributed to the celebrated   case of Coggs v. Bernard, 2 Ld Raym (Eng) 909 (1703), in which Chief Justice Holt by a separate opinion   examined in depth the question of the bailee’s liability. See Brown and Raushenbush, Law of Personal   Property (3d ed.) § 11.1. Over the years the scheme lost favor and was replaced by another classification   that was derived in part from the decision of Justice Holt and from a view adopted by Justice Story. See   Brown, supra, at p. 255. The latter view is the common law of most states today. It divides bailments into   three classifications: sole benefit of the bailor; sole benefit of the bailee; and the mutual benefit of both.   Under this classification the duty of the bailee depends upon which party derives the greater benefit.     If the bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailor, the bailee has a duty to exercise slight care.   If the bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailee, the bailee has a duty of great care. If the bailment is   mutual or for the benefit of both, the bailee has a duty to exercise ordinary care. While it represents a great   improvement over the early common law, the application of the rule has created problems. One learned   author states:                  "      “These difficulties, both conceptual in terms of theory and practical in terms of how   to instruct a jury, have led to some discontentment with the three classes of bailments and   the accompanying three standards of care. It would be more understandable and easier to   administer if, regardless of the nature of the bailment, the bailee were held to a standard   of ‘ordinary care under the circumstances’ which could be considered in judging whether   the bailee’s conduct met the standard. Some courts have so held.” Brown, supra, 11.1, at   p. 7.     Maddock is listed as authority for the modern view.      In Bank v. McCutchan, 111 Kan. 682, 687, 208 P. 636 (1922), the Kansas Supreme Court held that   the trial court did not commit error by failure to instruct on the various degrees of negligence in a bailment   of securities. The court referred to a prior appeal in the case, Bank v. Bank, 106 Kan. 303, 187 P. 697 (1920),   wherein it had determined that “a national bank is liable for the negligent loss of property entrusted to it for   disposition according to instructions whether the bailment be for a profit or merely for accommodation of   its customers.” 111 Kan. at 683.      Where bailed property is damaged in the possession of the bailee as the result of the bailee’s   negligence, the bailor has a choice of remedies. The bailor may elect to affirm the contract, waive the tort,   and bring his action in contract; or he may abandon the contract and proceed against the bailee in an action   in tort based upon the negligence of the bailee. See Nolan v. Auto Transporters, 226 Kan. 176, 183, 597   P.2d 614 (1979).     The bailee in a bailment for mutual benefit must use ordinary care in safeguarding the property in   order to prevent its damage or theft. M. Bruenger & Co., Inc. v. Dodge City Truck Stop, Inc., 234 Kan. 682,   675 P.2d 864 (1984).       2020      "      2020      <h4><a name='124.73' href='124.73'>124.73</a></h4><p>BAILMENT—NEGLIGENCE OF THE BAILEE—   BURDEN OF PROOF      When bailed property is destroyed or damaged while in the exclusive   possession and control of the bailee, the law presumes the bailee’s negligence   to be the cause of the loss and the bailee has the burden to prove that the loss   was due to other causes consistent with due care on (his) (her) part.

The bailor has made a prima facie case of negligence against the bailee if the bailor shows that the   property was delivered and the bailee has failed to return it. A presumption of negligence on the part of the   bailee arises and the bailee has the burden of going forward with evidence to explain the failure to redeliver.   M. Bruenger & Co., Inc. v.

The rule is that while the bailor is not an   absolute insurer against injuries from a defective chattel, he is charged with the duty   of inspection to determine whether or not the chattel is fit for the purpose intended.   Thus, if the defect were discoverable, he became liable for injuries to the bailee, arising   from this unsafe condition, under the theory of an implied warranty of fitness.

The definition of legal malice should be given with this instruction. As stated in Turner, “Both   tortious interference with a contract and tortious interference with contractual expectations or a prospective   business advantage are predicated on malicious conduct by the defendant.” 240 Kan. at 12. The definition   of legal malice is set forth in PIK 4" : “Malice is the intent to do harm without any reasonable   justification or excuse.”     The Committee recognizes that the Supreme Court in Turner held that the plaintiff, who was alleging   tortious interference with contract, must prove actual malice. The court defined actual malice as “evil-   mindedness or specific intent to injure.” 240 Kan. at 8. “Where the allegation of tortious interference   with contract, or the prospect of a contract, is based upon alleged defamatory statements from the former   employers to the prospective employer, we hold that such communication is subject to a qualified privilege   which requires the plaintiff to prove actual malice by the defendant in making such communication.” 240   Kan. at 14. Based on the language in the Turner opinion, the Committee believes that legal malice, and not   actual malice, is still the required element for claims of tortious interference that do not involve defamation,   a qualified privilege or other claims or defenses having constitutional underpinnings.     Where the alleged interference is based on defamatory statements made by the defendant, see PIK   4"  et seq. for applicable instructions on the tort of defamation. Where a qualified or conditional   privilege is asserted as a defense to a claim based on defamatory statements, PIK 4" , Qualified or   Conditional Privilege, should be given.      2020      "      2020      Comment      In Hawkinson v. Bennett, 265 Kan. 564, 599, 962 P.2d 445 (1998), the district court instructed the jury   that the defendants must have induced the breach of the contract with actual malice in order for plaintiffs to   recover for tortious interference with a contract. The jury was instructed that “ ‘actual malice’ means actual   evil-mindedness or special intent to injure.” 265 Kan. at 600. Neither party challenged these instructions   on appeal, and the Supreme Court did not comment on the propriety of requiring actual malice.     In DP-Tek, Inc. v. AT & T Global Information Co., 891 F. Supp. 1510 (D. Kan. 1995), the federal   district court noted that, “This court does not believe that the Turner case supports an interpretation that   actual malice is required for a finding of wrongful conduct sufficient to support a tortious interference claim.   While the Turner case does discuss an actual malice standard, that is only because the plaintiff’s tortious   interference claim was based upon alleged defamatory statements made by the defendant former employer.   This court does not interpret Turner to require a showing of actual malice to support a tortious interference   claim when the claim is not based upon defamation. Other Kansas authorities, and the Restatement, make   no mention of an actual malice requirement.”      A claim for tortious interference with a contractual relationship requires the existence of a valid and   enforceable contract at the time of the interference between the plaintiff and a third party.

Southwest National Bank, 593 F. Supp. 250 (D. Kan.   1984), and adopted by the Kansas Supreme Court in Turner v. Halliburton Co., 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106   (1986). Although the Kansas cases, including Turner, never include malice in enumerating the elements of   this tort, the Kansas Supreme Court has made it clear that an action for tortious interference with a contract   is always predicated on malicious conduct by the defendant. Dickens v. Snodgrass, Dunlap & Co.,255 Kan.   164, 169, 872 P.2d 252 (1994), and Hawkinson v. Bennet, 265 Kan. 564, 599, 962 P.2d 445 (1998). See also   Reebles, Inc. v. Bank of America N.A., 29 Kan.

Other Kansas authorities, and the Restatement, make no mention of an actual malice   requirement.”     Not all interference in present or future contractual relations is tortious. A person may be privileged   or justified to interfere with the contractual relations in certain situations. See May v. Santa Fe Trail   Transportation Co., 189 Kan. 419, 370 P.2d 390 (1962).

Justification exists when the defendant acts in the exercise of a right equal to   or superior to that of the plaintiff and used fair means and good faith for some   lawful interest or purpose.      In determining whether the interference was justified, the following   factors should be considered:      1. the nature of the defendant’s conduct;     2. the defendant’s motive;     3. the interests of the plaintiff with which the defendant’s conduct   interfered;     4. the interests sought to be advanced by the defendant;     5. the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the   defendant and the contractual interests of the plaintiff;     6. the proximity or remoteness of the defendant’s conduct to the   interference; and     7. the relations between the parties.      Notes on Use      Authority for this instruction is found in Turner v. Halliburton Co., 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106   (1986). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767.      Where qualified or conditional privilege is asserted as a defense to a claim based on defamatory   statements, PIK 4"  should be given.      Comment      In Turner v. Halliburton Co., 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106 (1986), the court stated that a person   may be privileged or justified to interfere with contractual relations in certain situations. The court cited   the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767, which uses the factors enumerated in the above instruction to   determine whether the alleged interference was “improper.” The court also cited Prosser and Keeton on the   Law of Torts (5th ed.) § 129 for the proposition that, “Occasions privileged under the law of defamation are   also occasions in which interference with contractual relations may be considered justified or privileged.”      The Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 3 address whether the alleged interference is “improper”   in certain, special situations and in such situations the specific provisions of §§ 3 apply rather   than the general factors listed in § 767. In DP-Tek, Inc. v. AT & T Global Information Co., 891 F. Supp.   1510 (D. Kan. 1995), the federal district court noted that Kansas courts have adopted other portions of   the Restatement in regards to the torts of tortious interference and concluded the Kansas Supreme Court   would, in the proper factual circumstances, adopt the business competitor privilege set forth in § 768 of the   Restatement.      2020      "       A defense of justification to a tortious interference claim must be affirmatively pled. Burrowwood   Assocs., Inc. v. Safelite Glass Corp., 18 Kan. App. 2d 396, 853 P.2d 1175 (1993).     See K.S.A. 44-119a, which grants an employer qualified or absolute immunity in connection with   disclosures of certain information about a current or former employee to a prospective employer of such   employee.     Reebles, Inc. v. Bank of America, N.A., 29 Kan.

A confidential or fiduciary relationship is any relationship of blood,   business, friendship or association in which one of the parties places special   trust and confidence in the other.      A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists in a case in which there has   been a special confidence placed in one who, in equity and good conscience,   is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interest of the one   placing the confidence.      Notes on Use      The Committee recommends this instruction for the purpose of explaining to the jury the nature of a   fiduciary relationship, whether the relationship has been established as a matter of law or whether a factual   issue 1s presented for the jury’s determination. This instruction has been drawn to cover either situation.      Comment      A fiduciary relationship does not depend upon some technical relationship created by, or defined in,   law. It may exist under a variety of circumstances, and does exist in cases where there has been a special   confidence reposed in one who, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due   regard to the interests of the one reposing the confidence. Ford v. Guarantee Abstract & Title Co., 220   Kan. 244, 553 P.2d 254 (1976), later proceeding 228 Kan. 532, 618 P.2d 1195 (1980), overruled on other   grounds 232 Kan. 76, 652 P.2d 665 (1982).      Whether or not a confidential or fiduciary relationship exists depends on the facts and circumstances   of each individual case. Kansas appellate courts have declined for that reason to give an exact definition of   confidential or fiduciary relationships. Moore v. Moore, 56 Kan. App. 2d 301, Syl. 9 4, 429 P. 3d 607 (2018),   rev. denied 309 Kan. 1348 (2019). Courts of equity have refrained from defining the particular instances   of fiduciary relationships in such a manner that other and perhaps new cases might be excluded, and have   refused to set any bounds to the circumstances out of which a fiduciary relationship may spring. It extends   to every possible case in which a fiduciary relationship exists in fact, and in which there is confidence   reposed on one side and resulting domination and influence on the other. Denison State Bank v. Madeira,   230 Kan. 684, 230 Kan. 815, 640 P.2d 1235 (1982). See also Brown v. Foulks, 232 Kan. 424, 657 P.2d 501   (1983).     Kansas appellate courts have used the terms “fiduciary” and “confidential” relationships   interchangeably. For example, in its discussion of the parties’ relationship in Moore v. Moore, supra, the   Court of Appeals cited both Brown v. Foulks, 232 Kan. 424, , 657 P.2d 501 (1983), and Nelson v.   Nelson, 38 Kan. App. 2d 64, 78 (2007), aff’d 288 Kan. 570, 205 P.3d 715 (2009). In Brown, the Supreme   Court held that the term “fiduciary relation” refers to “any relationship of blood, business, friendship, or      2020      "      2020      association in which one of the parties reposes special trust and confidence in the other who is in a position   to have and exercise influence over the first party.” In Ne/son, the Court of Appeals used identical language   to define a “confidential relationship.”     The concept of the fiduciary duty is an equitable one and while no precise definition may be given,   there are certain broad principles which should be considered in making a determination of whether a   fiduciary relationship exists in any particular factual situation. Denison State Bank v. Madeira, 230 Kan.   684, 230 Kan. 815, Syl. 13, 640 P.2d 1235 (1982).     It may be said that generally there are two types of fiduciary relationships: (1) those specifically   created by contract such as principal and agent, attorney and client, and trustee and cestui que trust, for   example, and those created by formal legal proceedings such as guardian and/or conservator and ward,   and executor or administrator of an estate, among others, and (2) those implied in law due to the factual   situation surrounding the involved transactions and the relationship of the parties to each other and to the   questioned transactions. The determination of the existence of a fiduciary relationship of the first category,   though not without problems on occasion, is usually relatively simple. The second category becomes more   difficult to determine and must depend upon the facts in each case. Denison State Bank v. Madeira, 230   Kan. 684, 691, 640 P.2d 1235 (1982).     The Kansas reports contain many cases where a fiduciary relationship has been found to exist   between the parties. A fiduciary relationship may exist between partners in an oil and gas lease, More v.   Burroughs, 111 Kan. 28, 205 P. 1029 (1922), or between the widow of a deceased partner and the surviving   partner in a lease, Miller v. Henderson, 140 Kan. 46, 33 P.2d 1098 (1934). Such a relationship may exist   between joint adventurers in a business enterprise, Paul v. Smith, 191 Kan. 163, 380 P.2d 421 (1963). It   has been held that a life tenant, with power to sell real property devised to her for life with remainder to   designated persons, is a quasi trustee and occupies a fiduciary relationship to the remaindermen and, in   the exercise of that power, she owes to them the highest duty to act honestly and in good faith by selling   property to a bona fide purchaser for the best price offered. Windscheffel v. Wright, 187 Kan. 678, 360 P.2d   178 (1961). See also In re Estate of Miller, 225 Kan. 655, 594 P.2d 167 (1979). The officers and directors of   a corporation occupy a strict fiduciary relationship with respect to both the corporation and its shareholders.   Newton v. Hornblower Inc., 224 Kan. 506, 582 P.2d 1136 (1978); Sampson v. Hunt, 222 Kan. 268, 564 P.2d   489 (1977). For discussion of the fiduciary duty of a corporate director in the context of a merger, see Jn re   Hesston Corp., 254 Kan. 941, 870 P.2d 17 (1994).      Where a law firm handles the sale of the working interests in oil and gas leases of all the owners   (including an opposing party in a prior, related lawsuit) and agrees to assume responsibility for collecting   revenue, deducting expenses, and paying to each owner that to which the owner is entitled, an agency   relationship exists and along with it, a fiduciary relationship. Gillespie v. Martin, Pringle, Oliver, Wallace   & Swartz, 258 Kan. 91, 899 P.2d 478 (1995).     Several of our cases recognize that a fiduciary relationship may exist between members of the same   family where land is deeded by one to the other and a confidence is in some way violated. Staab v. Staab,   160 Kan. 417, 163 P.2d 418 (1945); Overstreet v. Beadles, 151 Kan. 842, 101 P.2d 874 (1940); Silvers v.   Howard, 106 Kan. 762, 190 P. 1 (1920).      Fiduciary relationships may also arise from contractual relationships involving joint business   enterprises, where one party has superior knowledge and the other party justifiably relies on him. Wolf v.   Brungardt, 215 Kan. 272, 524 P.2d 726 (1974). See also First Bank of Wakeeney v. Moden, 235 Kan. 260,   681 P.2d 11 (1984).

Comment      In Jones v. Hansen, 254 Kan. 499, 867 P.2d 303 (1994), the court abolished the common-law   distinctions between the duties owed to invitees and licensees, while retaining the common-law rules   regarding trespassers. For this reason, the Committee has eliminated prior references to invitees and   licensees. The Jones v. Hansen totality of the circumstances rule was applied in Brock v. Richmond-Berea   Cemetery Dist., 264 Kan. 613, 957 P.2d 505 (1998). See also Seitz v. Lawrence Bank, 36 Kan. App. 2d 283,   138 P.3d 388 (2006).      The duty owed to others does not include a duty to remove or to warn of known and obvious dangers,   subject to a very limited obligation to minimize the risk when there is reason to expect a person on the   premises may be distracted from those dangers. See Miller v. Zep Mfg. Co., 249 Kan. 34, 815 P.2d 506   (1991), DiPietro v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 28 Kan. App. 2d 372, 16 P.3d 986 (2000), and Wellhausen v.   University of Kansas, 40 Kan.

In a slip and fall action, the court used the “slight defect rule,” holding that a slight irregularity in   a sidewalk is not sufficient to establish actionable negligence in the construction and maintenance of the   sidewalk. The court then held that the “slight defect rule” is not applied in cases where the irregularity in a   sidewalk is created by the negligent acts of the party against whom recovery is sought.

[When a dangerous condition is created or maintained by the (owner)   (operator) (occupier), or by one for whose acts the (owner) (operator) (occupier)   is responsible, knowledge of the condition is implied.|      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given in cases in which notice of an alleged dangerous condition is an   issue. The bracketed sentence should be included when there is evidence that the condition was created or   maintained by the proprietor or his employee.      Comment      With respect to the necessity of proof that the proprietor ofa place of business had notice ofa dangerous   condition alleged to have caused injury to an invitee, the cases are divided into two classes: (1) those in   which injuries to business visitors were caused by dangerous conditions negligently created or maintained   by the proprietor or his employees; and (2) those in which injuries were due to dangerous conditions that   came about through no active fault of the proprietor and that did not involve an instrumentality employed   by him in the conduct of his business. In the former, proof of notice is unnecessary. In the latter, it must   be shown that the proprietor had actual knowledge, or that the condition had existed for such a length of   time that in the exercise of ordinary care he should have known of it. PIK 4"  may be modified to fit   either or both situations. For authority, see Magness v. Sidmans Restaurants, Inc., 195 Kan. 30, 402 P.2d   767 (1965); Little v.

Hillcrest Bowl, Inc.,   199 Kan. 40, 427 P.2d 591 (1967), where the plaintiff had slipped and fallen on a wet terrazzo floor inside   an entrance to a building.      In a case involving a piece of lettuce on a floor, it was determined that neither actual nor constructive   notice was shown by the evidence. Smith v. Mr. D 5, Inc., 197 Kan. 83, 415 P.2d 251 (1966).     “A business proprietor, absent unusual circumstances, may await the end of a winter storm and   a reasonable time thereafter to remove ice and snow from outdoor entrance walks, platforms, or steps   because it is impractical to take action earlier.” Agnew v.

Hansen, 254 Kan. 499, 510-   11, 867 P.2d 303 (1994), the Kansas Supreme Court adopted the Agnew rationale, “adopting a standard of   reasonable care under all the circumstances for licensees and invitees in premises liability cases.”      "      2020      "      2012      <h4><a name='126.05' href='126.05'>126.05</a></h4><p>MODE OF OPERATION RULE      An (owner) (operator) (occupier of premises) of a business is liable for a   slip and fall injury that results from a dangerous condition if:      1. the business had adopted a mode of operation in which the dangerous   condition could regularly occur; and      2. the (owner) (operator) (occupier of premises) failed to use reasonable   measures, considering the risk involved, to discover the dangerous condition   and remove it.      Notes on Use      This instruction should only be used when the business has adopted a “mode of operation” such   as one used in self-service food markets where the proprietor could reasonably anticipate that hazardous   conditions would regularly arise.      Comment      Kansas courts have adopted the “mode-of-operation rule” which generally allows a plaintiff in a slip-   and-fall case to recover without a proprietor’s actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition   if the plaintiff shows the proprietor adopted a mode of operation where a patron’s carelessness should be   anticipated and the proprietor fails to use reasonable measures commensurate with the risk involved to   discover the condition and remove it. Jackson v. K-Mart Corp., 251 Kan. 700, 710, 840 P.2d 463 (1992).      The mode-of-operation instruction is properly given only in cases where the evidence establishes that   a company’s adoption of a particular mode of operation makes it reasonably foreseeable that a dangerous   condition could regularly occur.

The duty owed by an owner or occupier of premises   to a trespasser is to refrain from willfully, wantonly, or recklessly injuring the   trespasser.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given with the appropriate definition from PIK 4" , Wanton   Conduct Defined, PIK 4% , Willful Conduct Defined, and the applicable part of PIK 4% ,   defining Reckless Conduct.     In certain situations, consent to enter another’s property may be implied by the circumstances, with a   corresponding duty of reasonable care owed by the possessor of the property. In those circumstances, this   instruction should be given with PIK 4" , Private Necessity—Entering or Remaining on Property to   Prevent Serious Harm. See Wrinkle v. Norman, 297 Kan. 420, 301 P.3d 312 (2013).      Comment      For authority, see Montague v. Burgerhoff, 150 Kan. 217, 223, 92 P.2d 98 (1939), Riddle Quarries,   Inc. v.

Thompson, 177 Kan. 307,   311, 279 P.2d 266 (1955), citing Restatement, Torts § 329 (1934). See Restatement, Torts 2d § 329 (1965),   which provides:   “A trespasser is a person who enters or remains upon land in the possession   of another without a privilege to do so created by the possessor’s consent or   otherwise.”   See also Gerchberg v. Loney, 223 Kan. 446, 576 P.2d 593 (1978).      While the duty owed to licensees and invitees was changed in Jones v. Hansen, 254 Kan. 499, 509,   867 P.2d 303 (1994), the duty owed to trespassers remains unaffected. See also Seitz v. Lawrence Bank, 36   Kan. App. 2d 283, 138 P.3d 388 (2006). But see Wrinkle v. Norman, 297 Kan. 420, 301 P.3d 312 (2013),   where duty to trespassers is reaffirmed, subject to modification in certain circumstances of private necessity   or public purpose. See also K.S.A. 58-821, effective July 1, 2014.     A strong argument can be made that the duty owed a discovered trespasser is reasonable care under   the circumstances. See 49 A.L.R. 778; 156 A.L.R. 1226; Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts (2d ed.)   p. 436 § 76; Peaslee, Duty to Seen Trespassers, 27 Harvard L. Rev. 403 (1914).     In Frazee v. St. Louis-San Francisco Rly. Co., 219 Kan. 661, 549 P.2d 561 (1976), the court affirmed   the principle of law consistent with this instruction, indicating that “the only duty owed by landowner to a   trespassee is to refrain from willfully, wantonly or recklessly injuring him.”      2016      "      2014      <h4><a name='126.22' href='126.22'>126.22</a></h4><p>PRIVATE NECESSITY—ENTERING OR REMAINING   ON PROPERTY TO PREVENT SERIOUS HARM      A person has implied consent to (enter) (remain) on premises in the   possession of another and is not a trespasser if being on the premises is   necessary, or reasonably appears to be necessary, to prevent serious harm to   (the person entering the premises) (property of the person entering the premises)   (the person in possession of the premises) (property of the person in possession   of the premises) (another person) (property of another person).

Norman, 297 Kan. 420, 301 P.3d 312 (2013), the court adopted Restatement (Second)   of Torts §§ 197 and 345, with some modifications to comport with Kansas comparative negligence and   premises liability law. Together the sections “create a presumption of implicit permission for one party   to enter the property of another in order to prevent certain kinds of serious harm, and the possessor of the   property has a duty of reasonable care to protect the wellbeing of the person exercising that privilege.” 297   Kan. at 424.

Comment      In certain circumstances, a landlord may, by an exculpatory clause in a lease, exempt himself from   negligence. Talley v. Skelly Oil Co., 199 Kan. 767, 433 P.2d 425 (1967).     But see Borders v. Roseberry, 216 Kan. 486, 532 P.2d 1366 (1975), setting out the general principles   of law to be followed in the determination of liability of a landlord to a social guest of the tenant of leased   premises.      The rule was followed and judgment for defendant at close of plaintiff's evidence upheld, under   circumstances where a tenant died resulting from burns received when her clothing was ignited by an open-   faced gas heater. Tillotson v. Abbott, 205 Kan. 706, 472 P.2d 240 (1970).      An earlier version of this instruction is referred to and is recognized as in accordance with the law   in Bodnar v. Jackson, 205 Kan. 469, 470 P.2d 726 (1970), a case involving a claimed defective basement   stairway and banister.     In Jackson v. Wood, 11 Kan. App. 2d 478, 726 P.2d 796, rev. denied 240 Kan. 804 (1986), the court   held that a landlord’s duty of care owed to a social guest of his tenant is controlled, not by licensee-invitee   distinction, but by the common-law rule that landlord owes no duty to the guest except in certain specific   situations. One of those situations is where the landlord has contracted to keep the premises in repair. The   court then found that the Kansas Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in K.S.A. 58-2553(a)(3) imposes a   contract and duty of reasonable care on landlords subject to this Act.      See also Burch v. University of Kansas, 243 Kan. 238, 756 P.2d 431 (1988), where the court held that   the duty of the owner to exercise reasonable care in keeping a common area in a reasonably safe condition   extends to persons expressly or impliedly invited by a tenant, including social guests of a tenant.     In Colombel v. Milan, 24 Kan. App. 2d 728, 952 P.2d 941 (1998), the Court of Appeals upheld the   trial court’s dismissal of a lawsuit filed by a social guest of a tenant, against a landlord, when he had been   bitten by a tenant’s dog. The landlord, who was not a possessor, harborer, owner or keeper of the tenant’s   dog was not liable for the third party’s injuries.     The corporate owner of the real property that housed the local chapter of a fraternity at the University   of Kansas was not liable for personal injuries sustained by a minor as a result of excessive consumption   of alcoholic beverages. Prime v. Beta Gamma Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, 273 Kan. 828, 47 P.3d 402   (2002).                             "      <h4><a name='126.31' href='126.31'>126.31</a></h4><p>LANDLORD’S DUTY AS TO RESERVED PARTS      A landlord who leases parts of premises to different tenants and expressly   or impliedly reserves other parts thereof, such as (entrances) (halls) (stairways)   (porches) (walks), for the common use of different tenants, has a duty to   exercise reasonable care to keep those reserved parts in a safe condition for   use in the manner and for the purpose intended.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given only in instances where areas are reserved for use by more than one   tenant. PIK 4"  should be given with this instruction.      Comment      There is a difference in the duty owed by a landlord concerning premises leased to others and   concerning premises reserved and under the landlord’s control. The landlord’s duty as to care does not   extend to his tenants or their invitees with respect to areas other than those included in their leases or used   in common by the tenants, or to nonintended uses of an area. A tenant may become a licensee or trespasser.   For authority and collection of cases, see Trimble v. Spears, 182 Kan. 406, 320 P.2d 1029 (1958).      A landlord is liable for injuries to a tenant or his invitee resulting from a defect in a reserved area   when he knows of the defect, or by the exercise of ordinary care he should have known of it, and had an   opportunity to repair it.     In Ramirez v. Trail Ridge Apartments, Inc., 211 Kan. 112, 505 P.2d 757 (1973), the court cited this   instruction as being the correct statement of the law to reserved areas of the premises.     In Burch v. University of Kansas, 243 Kan. 238, 756 P.2d 431 (1988), the trial court concluded that a   housing contract between the University of Kansas and a student was technically not a lease in the traditional   sense. Consequently, a plaintiff grandmother, as an implied invitee and guest of her granddaughter, was not   protected under the common area exception.     The Supreme Court reversed, adopting the liberal approach taken by it in Albanese v. Edwardsville   Mobile Home Village, Inc., 215 Kan. 826, 529 P.2d 163 (1974), in applying the common area exception   under Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 360, 361. The court stated that “the term ‘lessor of land’ is to be   construed to include any contractual relationship, written or oral, where the owner of property leases land   and retains under his possession and control certain areas of the land which various renters or tenants are   entitled to use as appurtenant to the part leased to them.” Burch v. University of Kansas, 243 Kan. 238, 247,   756 P.2d 431 (1988).     “A business proprietor, absent unusual circumstances, may await the end of a winter storm and   a reasonable time thereafter to remove ice and snow from outdoor entrance walks, platforms, or steps   because it is impractical to take action earlier.” Agnew v. Dillons, Inc., 16 Kan. App. 2d 298, Syl. 1 2, 822   P.2d 1049 (1991). Failure to give an “Agnew instruction” was ruled not to be error in Worley v. Bradford   Pointe Apartments, Inc., 31 Kan. App. 2d 737, 73 P.3d 149 (2003). In Jones v. Hansen, 254 Kan. 499, 510-   11, 867 P.2d 303 (1994), the Kansas Supreme Court adopted the Agnew rationale, “adopting a standard of   reasonable care under all the circumstances for licensees and invitees in premises liability cases.”      2012      "       <h4><a name='126.32' href='126.32'>126.32</a></h4><p>LANDLORD’S PROMISE TO REPAIR      A landlord is liable for injuries caused to the landlord’s tenant (and   others on the land with the consent of the tenant) (and the tenant’s subtenant)   by a condition of disrepair when:      1. the landlord, as such, has (contracted) (promised) in the   lease or otherwise to keep the premises in repair, and      2. the disrepair creates an unreasonable risk to persons on   the premises which the performance of the landlord’s promise   would have prevented, and      3. the landlord fails to exercise reasonable care to perform   that (contract) (promise).      Notes on Use      If the landlord raises no issue of consideration for a promise to repair, the word “promised” in   subparagraph 1 should be used instead of the word “contracted.” If the landlord raises the issue of   consideration, then the word “contracted” should be used and instructions should be given in accordance   with PIK 4" , Definition of Contract; PIK 4° , Formation of Contracts; PIK 4" ,   Consideration; and, when appropriate, PIK 4" , Promissory Estoppel.      Comment      For authority, see Williams v. Davis, 188 Kan. 385, 362 P.2d 641 (1961), citing Restatement, Torts §   357 (1934), holding that an action exists for injuries to a seven-year-old boy who slipped and rolled through   the banister of a porch of an apartment rented by his parents on the landlord’s assurance to repair the porch   so it would not be dangerous to children. Also see Transport Insurance Co. v. Huston, 207 Kan. 759, 486   P.2d 1344 (1971), involving personal injuries resulting from the fall of a bumper used to absorb the shock   of trucks hitting a dock at a door where the bumper had been located. In the latter case, the Supreme Court   of Kansas stated that it adhered to the basic concept contained in Restatement (Second) of Torts § 357   (1965), which is the basis of the recommended instruction.     Concerning a lessor’s duty to repair, see Vieyra v. Engineering Investment Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 775,   473 P.2d 44 (1970), which involved personal injuries sustained when a freight elevator broke and fell to the   bottom of the shaft. In Vieyra, the Supreme Court of Kansas noted that when a lessor’s duty rests upon a   general contract to repair contained in a lease and no right of access or control is reserved, the lease defines   the extent of the lessor’s duty. It further stated that unless the lease provides for inspection by the lessor,   “the covenant to make necessary repairs to the interior of the premises in the exclusive control of lessee   subjects the lessor to no liability until the lessee has given him notice of the need for repairs and the lessor   thereafter fails to exercise reasonable care and diligence in making the repairs.”     Richardson v. Weckworth, 212 Kan. 84, 509 P.2d 1113 (1973), involved a crumbling sidewalk on   premises rented on a month-to-month basis. Although the landlords orally promised to repair the defective   condition when notified of it, they failed to do so and one of the tenants sustained personal injuries when   she fell as a result of catching her heel in one of the pockmarks in the defective sidewalk. In affirming   a judgment for the tenants, the Supreme Court of Kansas recognized that “the rule pertaining to public      2012                   "      sidewalks and city streets should not be universally applied in landlord-tenant litigation.” Further, it   refused to hold that the tenants had been contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Moreover, it refused   to consider the defense of lack of consideration for a promise to repair because the defense had not been   raised in the trial court. In addition, the court held that the terms “hazardous and dangerous conditions” and   “unreasonable risk” are readily understandable and that the trial court had not erred in refusing to define   them in its instructions to the jury.     For help in this general area, see Zinn, The Real Estate Lease in Kansas: Some Problems of   Characterization, 17 Kan. Law Rev. 707 (1969).     Where a municipal housing code prescribes minimum housing standards, by implication a lease   of urban residential property gives rise to an implied warranty by the landlord that leased premises are   habitable and suitable for human occupancy in compliance with the pertinent code provisions and will   remain so for the duration of the tenancy. Steele v. Latimer, 214 Kan. 329, 521 P.2d 304 (1974).     The recent trend among courts is to recognize an implied warranty by the lessor of urban residential   property that the premises leased are suitable for human habitation and will be maintained in a suitable   condition during the tenancy, regardless of existence of a municipal housing code with minimum housing   standards.     The Kansas Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (K.S.A. 58-2553(a)(3)) imposes a contract and   duty of reasonable care on landlords subject to the Act to “maintain in good and safe working order and   condition all ... heating, ventilating ... appliances ... supplied or required to be supplied by such landlord”   except when prevented by an act of God, the failure of public utility services or other conditions beyond   the landlord’s control.

The test you must use is whether under the totality of the circumstances,   a reasonable owner could foresee that patrons or customers have a risk of   being victims of criminal acts above and beyond what is ordinarily expected.   Some of the factors you should take into account are:      1. Whether the location is in a known high-crime area;     2. The amount of lighting;     3. The time of day that the crime was committed;     4. Prior incidents involving crimes upon patrons; and     5. The economic feasibility of a reasonable level of security.      The plaintiff must also prove that there is a causal connection between   the breach of this duty to provide security and the injury sustained.      Comment      For authority, see Seibert v. Vic Regnier Builders, Inc., 253 Kan. 540, 856 P.2d 1332 (1993). In   Seibert the Supreme Court adopted the “totality of the circumstances” rule of foreseeability. The court   stated, “The shopping center owner is not under a duty to provide such security as will prevent attacks   on the patrons—such a duty would make the owner the insurer of his patrons’ safety. Rather, if because   of the totality of the circumstances the owner has a duty to take security precautions by virtue of the   foreseeability of criminal conduct, such security measures must also be reasonable under the totality of the   circumstances.” Seibert v. Vic Regnier Builders, Inc., 253 Kan. 540, 550, 856 P.2d 1332 (1993).     The Seibert rule of foreseeability was applied in Gragg v. Wichita State Univ., 261 Kan. 1037, 934   P.2d 121 (1997), Weroha v. Craft, 24 Kan. App. 2d 693, 951 P.2d 1308, rev. denied 264 Kan. 825 (1998),   and South v.

Comment      For authority, see Carter v. Skelly Oil Co., 191 Kan. 474, 382 P.2d 277 (1963) (in which a thirteen-   year-old boy was injured in a burning oil slush pit); Brittain v. Cubbon, 190 Kan. 641, 378 P.2d 141 (1963),   citing Restatement, Torts § 339 (1934) (involving a ten-year-old child who stepped on a nail in the scattered   debris of a razed residential building); and Gerchberg v. Loney, 223 Kan. 446, 576 P.2d 593 (1978) (in   which a five-year-old was burned at a trash incinerator).     The doctrine had its beginning in railroad turntable cases. The rule is stated and the cases are collected   in Moseley v. City of Kansas City, 170 Kan. 585, 228 P.2d 699 (1951); Galleher v. City of Wichita, 179 Kan.   513, 296 P.2d 1062 (1956) (holding that where a city did not create a nuisance on lands not owned by it, its   failure to abate that nuisance did not make it liable to the parents of a five-year-old boy who was drowned   as a result of its maintenance); and Shank v. Peabody Cooperative Equity Exchange, 186 Kan. 648, 352   P.2d 41 (1960) (in which an eleven-year-old boy was killed by a lethal chemical at a grain warehouse).     The owner of a thing dangerous and attractive to children is not always liable to a child tempted by   the attraction. His liability bears a relation to the character of the thing, to the comparative ease or difficulty   of preventing the danger without destroying the usefulness of the thing, and, in short, to the reasonableness   and propriety of his own conduct under the conditions then existing. Brittain v. Cubbon, 190 Kan. 641, 378   P.2d 141 (1963).     In Brittain v. Cubbon, 190 Kan. 641, 378 P.2d 141 (1963), and Moseley v. City of Kansas City, 170   Kan. 585, 228 P.2d 699 (1951), it was held that the doctrine only applies to children of tender years. In the   latter case, it was held inapplicable to a boy sixteen years of age of low intelligence and of backward and      2010      "      2010      arrested mentality. This case also discussed the term “tender years” and notes that the doctrine is rarely   applied to children over ten years of age and in relatively few instances to older children up to fourteen.     A tractor and an attached disc, left standing in a farm field with the ignition key in the switch, in   connection with which a four-year-old boy was injured, was held not to be an attractive nuisance, the owner   having had no knowledge and no opportunity to know that children had or would play upon the machinery   located on private property. McGaughey v. Haines, 189 Kan. 453, 370 P.2d 120 (1962).     The doctrine does not apply to swimming pools; it applies only to latent defects, not to patent defects.   McCormick v. Williams, 194 Kan. 81, 83, 397 P.2d 392 (1964); Mozier v. Parsons, 256 Kan. 769, 887 P.2d   692 (1995).      The attractive nuisance doctrine may impose liability to trespassing children upon an owner or   occupant. For discussion and a collection of cases, see Caywood v. Board of County Commissioners., 200   Kan. 134, 434 P.2d 780 (1967).

Firing a BB gun by a child in a backyard enclosed by a strong wall of substantial height, coupled   with no knowledge on the part of defendant parent, makes the doctrine of attractive nuisance inapplicable.   Roberts v. Beebe, 200 Kan. 119, 434 P.2d 789 (1967). For a discussion of the comparative negligence of a   child as well as the attractive nuisance doctrine, see Honeycutt v.

The attractive nuisance doctrine or theory of recovery is limited to trespassing children. Mozier v.   Parsons, 256 Kan. 769, 887 P.2d 692 (1995).                              "      <h4><a name='126.50' href='126.50'>126.50</a></h4><p>ABUTTING PROPERTY OWNER—DUTY      It is the duty of an owner of land adjacent to or abutting upon a (highway)   (street) (sidewalk) to construct and maintain the structures on the owner’s   land so that they do not endanger the safety of travelers lawfully using the   (highway) (street) (sidewalk).      Comment      For authority, see Durst v. Wareham, 132 Kan. 785, 297 P. 675 (1931), involving a structure near   an alley. The rule was applied with regard to an open stairway near a sidewalk in Bennett v.

Foran, 143 Kan. 191, 53 P.2d 490 (1936); and with regard to machinery placed   in an alley in Osage City v. Larkins, 40 Kan. 206, 19 P. 658 (1888).     An abutting property owner is not liable for defects in a sidewalk, but this rule does not apply when   the defects complained of are created by and are the result of the owner’s negligence. Harris v. McConnell,   194 Kan. 800, 401 P.2d 908 (1965).     A landowner has a right to temporarily deposit building materials in abutting streets, if required to   improve his property, even though the public may be inconvenienced to some extent. Watson v. City of   Topeka, 194 Kan. 585, 400 P.2d 689 (1965).

McElroy, 207 Kan. 233, 484 P.2d 1010 (1971).     In a wrongful death action arising out of an accident in which decedent’s car left the roadway and   struck a utility pole and guy wire, the court cited Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 368 concerning liability   of a possessor of land for artificial conditions near an existing highway. While it is common knowledge   that vehicles on occasion leave the roadway and strike adjacent utility poles and guy wires, a duty to third   persons will not be imposed upon those who erect and maintain such objects in the absence of reasonable      anticipation of such deviation from the roadway as a normal incident of travel.

The term nuisance means something which unreasonably interferes with   the rights of a person, whether in person, property, or enjoyment of property   or comfort, and something which is an annoyance, that which annoys or   causes trouble or vexation, that which is offensive or noxious, or something   that works harm, inconvenience, or damage.      Comment      For authority, see Wilburn v. Boeing Airplane Co., 188 Kan. 722, 366 P.2d 246 (1961).     The operation of a sewer system was held a nuisance in Jeakins v. City of El Dorado, 143 Kan. 206,   53 P.2d 798 (1936); and a city dump in Steifer v. City of Kansas City, 175 Kan. 794, 267 P.2d 474 (1954),   and in Lehmkuhl v. City of Junction City, 179 Kan. 389, 295 P.2d 621 (1956); but a traffic condition was   held not a nuisance in Wilburn v. Boeing Airplane Co., 188 Kan. 722, 366 P.2d 246 (1961). No nuisance   was found to have been alleged in Weast v. Budd, 186 Kan. 249, 349 P.2d 912 (1960), in which case a city   had instituted and then abandoned eminent domain proceedings.      The distinction between a nuisance, to which governmental immunity does not attach, and negligence,   to which it does attach, turns upon whether the condition was one created by the municipality itself or was   one otherwise created or occurring that the municipality failed to use the requisite care in remedying.   Galleher v. City of Wichita, 179 Kan. 513, 296 P.2d 1062 (1956) (an abandoned sand pit used as a place   for fishing and swimming was an alleged dangerous place that had not been created or maintained by the   city).     For a collection of cases on what constitutes a governmental function and on the exceptions to the   tule of governmental immunity, see Stolp v. City of Arkansas City, 180 Kan. 197, 303 P.2d 123 (1956),   adhered to 181 Kan. 225, 310 P.2d 888 (1957).      A Board of Education did not create or maintain a nuisance where an employee within the scope of   his authority left a stump fire unextinguished and unattended and a child was injured thereby. Temporary   nature and isolated instance prevents nuisance. Rose v. Board of Education, 184 Kan. 486, 337 P.2d 652   (1959).     The decisionsasto nuisance are collected and classified in Caywood v. Board of County Commissioners,   200 Kan. 134, 434 P.2d 780 (1967), a case involving a lake operated, maintained, and open to the public as   a recreational facility.      A nuisance is an annoyance, and any use of property that is offensive or endangers life or health   or violates the laws of decency or unreasonably pollutes the air with foul, noxious odors or smoke, or   obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use and enjoyment of the property of another may be said to be a   nuisance. The alleged use of excessive force in an arrest for double-parking and subsequent harassment by   public authorities was held not to constitute a nuisance. Allen v. City of Ogden, 210 Kan. 136, 499 P.2d 527   (1972).     Failure to provide drainage for surface waters was held not to be actionable as a nuisance. Baldwin   v. City of Overland Park, 205 Kan. 1, 468 P.2d 168 (1970).                  "            Where a city contracts with another to collect and dispose of trash and retains control of the collection   and disposal, the conduct of the contractor giving rise to a nuisance renders the city liable for the nuisance.   Davis v. City of Kansas City, 204 Kan. 524, 464 P.2d 154 (1970).     PIK 4"  has been amended to be consistent with the definition of “nuisance” found in PIK 4"   .     Where a nuisance has its origin in negligence, as distinguished from an absolute nuisance, contributory   negligence is a defense. When tort liability is predicated on conduct less culpable than “intentional,” the      rule is to compare fault and causation. Sandifer Motors, Inc. v. City of Roeland Park, 6 Kan.

Comment      See George v. Ayesh, 179 Kan. 324, 295 P.2d 660 (1956), which holds that as to areas which are   retained by a landlord for the benefit of his tenants in common, the landlord’s duty also extends to a person   expressly or impliedly invited by the tenant and also to all of those who have lawful occasion to visit the   tenant for social purposes.     A pedestrian who uses a sidewalk should use due care for his own safety. Taggart v. Kansas City, 156   Kan. 478, 134 P.2d 417 (1943).     The rule embodied in the last sentence of the instruction was applied in Bingham v. Hillcrest Bowl,   Inc., 199 Kan. 40, 427 P.2d 591 (1967), where the plaintiff had slipped on a wet terrazzo floor inside the   entrance to a building, held no duty to look for danger when there is no reason to do so.     Knowing that an object is present does not constitute negligence as a matter of law, even though   there may be a comprehension of some risk. Autry v. Walls I. G. A.

That person is responsible for any damage if it   escapes the person’s property, regardless of the care exercised.      Comment      This statement of the early doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher, L.R. 3, H.L 330 (Eng. 1868), as a   common-law principle of liability without fault, was adopted and adhered to in State Highway Comm.   v. Empire Oil & Ref. Co., 141 Kan. 161, 40 P.2d 355, (1935), involving the escape of oil refuse from   premises, which refuse flowed down a watercourse forming a part of a state highway and when ignited, as   result of a weed-burning operation, destroyed a bridge. See also Berry v. Shell Petroleum Co., 140 Kan. 94,   33 P.2d 953, reh. denied 141 Kan. 6, 40 P.2d 359 (1934), emphasizing that liability does not spring from   negligence, and that negligence is not a necessary element of the right to recover. The right to recover is   based on a defendant’s maintenance of the harmful substance on his land and on his permitting it to escape   to the damage of a plaintiff. See also Jones v. Hittle Service, Inc., 219 Kan. 627, 549 P.2d 1383 (1976).      The escape of oil, refuse, and poisonous substance over the land of another, causing damage, was   held actionable in Helms v. Eastern Kansas Oil Co., 102 Kan. 164, 169 P. 208 (1917).     Outside the area of products liability, the doctrine of strict liability is applicable only to abnormally   dangerous activities. In Arnold Associates, Inc. v. City of Wichita, 5 Kan. App. 2d 301, 615 P.2d 814, rev.   denied 229 Kan. 669 (1980), the court held that maintenance of a twelve-inch water main was not such   an unusual or dangerous activity as to invoke the doctrine. The Arnold case was later cited in Williams v.   Amoco Production Co., 241 Kan. 102, 115, 734 P.2d 1113 (1987), as having adopted Sections 519 and   520, Restatement (Second) of Torts. The Supreme Court then adopted those sections and applied them to   the facts of the Williams case in determining that, under those facts, natural gas was not an abnormally   dangerous substance. For a discussion of Section 519 (the general rule for strict liability in this area) and   Section 520 (the test for determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous), see Williams, 241 Kan.   at .     Acomprehensive decision regarding the doctrine of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities   is found in the case of Pullen v. West, 278 Kan. 183, 3, 92 P.3d 584 (2004), where the Supreme   Court, without determining that the discharge of commercial grade fireworks is an abnormally dangerous   activity, held that a plaintiff’s participation in that activity precludes him from relying on strict liability.     In Eastman v. Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, 295 Kan. 470, 284 P.3d 1049 (2012),   the court distinguished common-law strict liability from strict liability under K.S.A. 65-6203. As with   common-law strict liability, K.S.A. 65-6203(a) imposes duties “regardless of any intent, negligence,   or misconduct of the person responsible for [an] accidental release or discharge.” Unlike common-law   strict liability, the statute “does not consider whether the responsible party was engaged in an abnormally   dangerous activity.”     Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 519 and 520 apply to strict liability claims when water contamination   is alleged.

The degree of care must be equal to the degree of danger involved.      Comment      The degree of care must be commensurate with the danger involved. See Wroth v. McKinney, 190   Kan. 127, 373 P.2d 216 (1962), concerning a loaded revolver. This rule applies in the transportation of   natural gas. Sternbock v.

A high-voltage line is one of the most dangerous things known to man and distributors of electricity   maintaining electric power lines are under the highest degree of care to protect the public from danger.   Cope v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 192 Kan. 755, 391 P.2d 107 (1964).     This instruction was approved in Negley v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 229 Kan. 465, 473, 625 P.2d 472   (1981).     In a case where a parent sought to impose liability upon the father of another minor who had shot   and killed her child with a handgun, Long v. Turk, 265 Kan. 855, 962 P.2d 1093 (1998), the Supreme Court   ruled that a .357 Magnum handgun is a dangerous instrumentality, and the highest degree of care is required   in the safeguarding of such a handgun.      The Supreme Court again applied a dangerous instrumentality standard in Shirley v. Glass, 297   Kan. 888, 308 P.3d 1 (2013). A man with convictions for violent felonies was involved, along with his   grandmother, defendant Glass, in the purchase of a shotgun. He later used the gun to kill his eight year   old son and himself. The court wrote that “. . . those in possession of firearms should exercise the highest   standard of care in deterring the possession of those firearms by those who are at special risk to misuse the   weapons. The legislature has determined that certain convicted felons fall within that special-risk group,   and a firearms dealer must exercise the highest standard of care in order to avoid selling guns to such   felons.” 297 Kan. at 901.      2016      "      2014      <h4><a name='126.90' href='126.90'>126.90</a></h4><p>ANIMALS—RUNNING AT LARGE      An owner of livestock must use due care to keep the livestock from   running at large.      To “run at large” means to stroll without restraint or confinement, to   wander, rove, or ramble at will without restraint.      An owner of livestock is liable for damages caused by the livestock   running at large, if the owner knows or through the use of reasonable care   should know that the livestock (is)(are) running at large.      An owner is not liable for damages caused by livestock that escape from   an enclosure or pen which the owner, through the use of reasonable care,   constructed or maintained in such a way as to confine livestock of that kind.      If the livestock escape(s), even without the owner’s fault, the owner has   the duty to use reasonable care to recover the livestock.      Notes on Use      For the definition of “livestock,” see K.S.A. 47-120(b).      Comment      See K.S.A. 47-122 and 47-123. In Wilson v. Rule, 169 Kan. 296, 219 P.2d 690 (1950), a case dealing   with a collision between an automobile and a mule, the Supreme Court in interpreting K.S.A. 47-122 and   47-123, required the plaintiff to show some evidence that the owner of the mule had failed to exercise due   care in enclosing it, in order to recover. Abbott v. Howard, 169 Kan. 305, 219 P.2d 696 (1950), reaffirms   the requirement to show negligence in a case involving the collision between an automobile and a horse.   See Clark v. Carson, 188 Kan. 261, 362 P.2d 71 (1961), which deals with the collision of an automobile   and a cow.

Cooper v.   Eberly, 211 Kan. 657, 508 P.2d 943 (1973). See also Walborn v. Stockman, 10 Kan. App. 2d 597, 706 P.2d   465 (1985).     In Wrinkle v. Norman, 297 Kan. 420, 301 P.3d 312 (2013), the court considered a case in which   the plaintiff was injured attempting to return cattle running at large to a pen on a neighbor’s property.   Considering the duty of care owed the plaintiff, who entered the property without express permission, the   court adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 197 and 345, with some modifications to comport with   Kansas comparative negligence and premises liability law. Together the sections “create a presumption of   implicit permission for one party to enter the property of another in order to prevent certain kinds of serious   harm, and the possessor of the property has a duty of reasonable care to protect the wellbeing of the person   exercising that privilege.” 297 Kan. at 424.

In adopting the doctrine of strict liability for a possessor of a wild animal who does harm to another,   the court cited this instruction and Carl, Administratrix v. Ackard, 114 Kan. 640, 220 P. 515 (1923), to   support its conclusion that Kansas appears to impose the same doctrine of strict liability as imposed on   owners of vicious domestic animals. It also found that the comparative fault principles of K.S.A. 60-258a   are applicable to strict liability cases. Mills v. Smith, 9 Kan. App. 2d 80, 673 P.2d 117 (1983).     Kansas does not impose liability on a landlord for the injuries inflicted upon a third person by a   tenant’s vicious dog. Only the owner, possessor, keeper, or harborer of a vicious animal can be held liable   for its actions. Colombel v. Milan, 24 Kan. App. 2d 728, 952 P.2d 941 (1998).                  "      <h4><a name='126.92' href='126.92'>126.92</a></h4><p>ANIMALS—ORDINARILY GENTLE      One who keeps an animal possessing only those dangerous propensities   that are normal to the members of its class is required to know its normal   habits and tendencies. That person is required to know that even ordinarily   gentle animals are likely to become dangerous under particular circumstances,   and to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm.      Comment      See Gardner v. Koenig, 188 Kan. 135, 360 P.2d 1107 (1961), citing The Restatement of Law, Torts §   518 (1938), in which a cause of action was held stated for injury resulting from the alleged negligence of a   sales barn owner in turning a nervous and unruly cow into a sales ring, unescorted and unattended. It was   stated that the proprietor should have anticipated that some cows would become nervous and uncontrollable,   and that they would resort to dangerous behavior if driven into a small enclosure, such as a sales ring, in the   presence of numerous spectators, where unfamiliar noises and confusion would be encountered.     The trial court properly applied the rule in sustaining a directed verdict for the defendant in a case   in which the defendant’s horse had fallen while the plaintiff was riding it. McKinney v. Cochran, 197 Kan.   524, 419 P.2d 931 (1966).     Liability for bodily injury caused by dogs falls within this rule. Berry v. Kegans, 196 Kan. 388, 411   P.2d 707 (1966).     In an action by a social guest or licensee who was injured while riding one of defendant’s horses   upon defendant’s property, the court held that the law relating to injury caused by an animal is the proper      law to apply as opposed to the rules of law pertaining to premises liability. Mercer v. Fritts, 236 Kan. 73,   689 P.2d 774 (1984).     Essentially, Mercer recognized a limited active negligence exception to the premises liability doctrine   when it held that animal law rather than premises law applied. A more recent case, Bowers v. Ottenad,   240 Kan. 208, 729 P.2d 1103 (1986), has been construed to extend the active negligence exception to all   situations where a licensee is injured by the negligent activity of the landowner.

ASSAULT AND BATTERY      <h4><a name='127.01' href='127.01'>127.01</a></h4><p>ASSAULT DEFINED      An assault is an intentional threat or attempt, coupled with apparent   ability, to do bodily harm to another, resulting in immediate apprehension of   bodily harm. No bodily contact is necessary.      Comment      An assault is an apparently violent attempt, or a willful offer with force or violence, to do corporal   injury to another, without the actual doing of the injury threatened, as by lifting the fist or a cane in a   threatening manner. Neither actual intent nor actual present ability to do the injury threatened is necessary   if the circumstances are such that the person threatened reasonably believes the injury will be done. State   v. Hazen, 160 Kan. 733, 740, 741, 165 P.2d 234 (1946). Plaintiff need not show a fear of being beaten or   severely injured to establish a claim for assault. Stapp v. Overnite Transp. Co., 995 F. Supp. 1207 (D. Kan.   1998). “[W]Jords can constitute assault if ‘together with other acts or circumstances they put the other in   reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact with his person.’” Restatement (Second)   of Torts § 31 (1964) quoted in Vetter v. Morgan, 22 Kan. App. 2d 1, 4, 913 P.2d 1200 (1995).     Mere words, however gross and abusive or insulting, and even though spoken for the purpose of   provoking an assault, are no defense to an action for assault and battery. State v. Hardisty, 122 Kan. 527,   529, 253 P. 615 (1927).     In considering a state pendent claim for assault, the United States District Court for the District of   Kansas held that whether plaintiff, a student athlete at defendant community college, was in immediate   apprehension of bodily harm was a question of fact to be decided by the jury where defendant’s baseball   coach had lined up players and was conducting a “cup check”—to see if players were wearing a liner in   their athletic supporters designed to protect the male genitalia—with a baseball bat and plaintiff stepped   back and agreed to take a fine out of fear of being struck as the coach approached with the bat. Lesser v.   Neosho County Community College, 741 F. Supp. 854 (D. Kan. 1990).      The act of a supervisor in slapping a female employee on her buttocks was held to constitute a   battery and a subsequent remark by the supervisor that he felt like repeating the act constituted assault.   Campbell v. Kansas State University, 780 F. Supp. 755 (D. Kan. 1991).      The element of immediate apprehension of bodily harm was proven where plaintiff testified she was   “scared and upset” and did not know what the aggressor was going to do, although plaintiff did not think   the aggressor was going to “beat her up” and she stayed in the same room with the aggressor after the   aggressor shoved her. Taiwo v. Vu, 249 Kan. 585, 822 P.2d 1024 (1991).                            "      <h4><a name='127.02' href='127.02'>127.02</a></h4><p>BATTERY DEFINED      A battery is the unprivileged touching or striking of one person by another,   done with the intent to cause a contact, or an apprehension of contact, that is   harmful or offensive.      Notes on Use      An action based on use of force by an officer may require instructions on negligence (PIK 4" ),   battery (above), wanton conduct (PIK 4" ), malice (PIK 4" ) and punitive damages (PIK 4"   ).      Comment      An intent to injure is a prerequisite in battery cases. Murray v. Modoc State Bank, 181 Kan. 642, 646,   313 P.2d 304 (1957).     A master is liable for assaults committed by his servant upon a customer, patron, or other invitee,   where such assaults are committed by the servant while acting within the scope of his employment. Murray   v. Modoc State Bank, 181 Kan. 642, 654, 313 P.2d 304 (1957).     The gravamen of a civil assault and battery is grounded upon the actor’s intention to inflict injury.   Stricklin v. Parsons Stockyard Co., 192 Kan. 360, 366, 388 P.2d 824 (1964).     The “intent to injure” is a necessary element of the intentional tort of battery. The intent to injure   “can be satisfied in alternative ways — either by (1) an intent to cause a harmful bodily contact, that is, to   cause the other physical injury; or by (2) an intent to cause an offensive bodily contact, that is, to invade   the other’s reasonable sense of personal dignity. Both states of mind are sufficiently culpable to justify   imposing civil battery liability for damages, including any physical injury that is legally caused by the   resulting bodily contact.” McElhaney v. Thomas, 307 Kan. 45, 405 P.3d 1214 (2017), disapproved contrary   language and the nebulous concept of “horseplay” in Stricklin v. Parsons Stockyard Co., 192 Kan. 360,   366, 388 P.2d 824 (1964).      Damages for personal injuries may be recovered for an unlawful, forcible, and malicious battery   even though the wrongful act may have also violated a criminal statute. Carrick v. McFadden, 216 Kan.   683, 533 P.2d 1249 (1975).      In Dauffenbach v. City of Wichita, 8 Kan. App. 2d 303, 657 P.2d 582, affirmed 233 Kan. 1028, 667   P.2d 380 (1983), plaintiff became obstreperous and verbally abusive when asked by officers for his driver’s   license after he appeared at the scene of an attempted burglary. Plaintiff was never arrested but the officers   met his attempt to leave and a swing at one of them with the use of force. Plaintiff was flung to the ground   and received injuries that rendered him paraplegic. In granting judgment for defendants the trial court   concluded that a peace officer is presumed to have acted properly until that presumption is overcome by   clear and convincing evidence. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that an officer is not entitled to that   presumption as part of plaintiff’s burden of proof.     The original cause pleaded was battery. It was amended to negligence in the use of unreasonable   force. The opinion of the Court of Appeals, adopted verbatim for the most part by the Supreme Court,   discusses liability of an officer for the use of force and identifies three bases: “The officer may not ... use an   unreasonable amount of force or wantonly or maliciously injure a suspect.” Dauffenbach, 8 Kan. App. 2d      2018      "      2018      at 308. The use of an unreasonable amount of force is equated with negligence: “We see no reason to make   a distinction between a traffic accident which involves a motor vehicle driven by a law enforcement officer   (or the felling of a tree) and the unreasonable use of force.” Id., 8 Kan. App. 2d at 309.     Reference is made to K.S.A. 21-3215(1) [now K.S.A. 21-5227(a)], which places limits upon the   force an officer can use in making an arrest. The court says compliance with that statute is a defense to   a criminal charge and there is no reason why the criminal and civil liability of an officer should not be   coextensive. The use of force likely to cause great bodily harm may be negligence per se. /d., 8 Kan. App.   2d at 310.     In Caplinger v. Carter, 9 Kan. App. 2d 287, 676 P.2d 1300 rev. denied 235 Kan. 1041 (1984), the   trial court granted summary judgment for defendants in an action based on, inter alia, battery. Plaintiffs’   discovery evidence showed plaintiffs were beaten and kicked during the course of arrest and booking, and   after release from custody, on misdemeanor charges of obstructing an official duty and disorderly conduct   arising from stop of an automobile to investigate the sobriety of the driver. Respecting the cause for battery,   the Court of Appeals found erroneous the trial court’s holding that the officers had immunity under the   Kansas Tort Claims Act, K.S.A. 75-6101 et seq. The court quotes from Dauffenbach, 233 Kan. 1028, 667   P.2d 380 (1983), and says that none of the exceptions to liability contained in the Kansas Tort Claims Act   “were intended to permit police officers to violate the prohibition in Dauffenbach that they shall not use   unreasonable force.” 9 Kan. App. 2d at 295.     The rules applicable to a determination of whether an officer was justified in the use of deadly force   to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect are stated in Ryder v. City of Topeka, 814 F.2d 1412 (10" Cir.   1987).     In Smith v. Welch, 265 Kan. 868, 967 P.2d 727 (1998), an action for assault, battery, sexual battery   and outrage against a neurologist employed as an independent medical examiner by the defendant in an   automobile negligence case, plaintiff testified the physician groped and fondled her breasts and attempted   to fondle her pubic area. Plaintiff’s expert testified such actions were unnecessary and inappropriate in   a neurological examination for head and neck injuries. The ruling of the trial court granting summary   judgment for the physician was reversed, the Supreme Court holding that a traditional physician-patient   relationship was not created, that unless consented to every medical examination is a technical invasion of   privacy, battery or trespass, regardless of result, and that a physician-patient relationship is irrelevant in a   claim for an intentional tort.                 "      <h4><a name='127.03' href='127.03'>127.03</a></h4><p>LIABILITY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY      Every person has a right to immunity from assault and battery, and to   complete protection against any violence whatever, whether injury results   from it or not. If you find from the evidence that the defendant committed an   unjustified assault or battery upon the plaintiff, then the defendant is liable   for damages sustained as the result of the wrongful act.      Notes on Use      This instruction should follow PIK 4" , Assault Defined, or PIK 4 , Battery Defined,   depending on whether assault or battery or both are involved.      Comment      An assault upon another is an intentional infringement upon the absolute right of personal security,   for which the law gives a right of action against the wrongdoer. Damages for mental suffering may be   awarded although there is no battery or bodily injury inflicted. Whitsel v. Watts, 98 Kan. 508, 159 P. 401   (1916); Lonergan v.

If this instruction is given, an instruction on Affirmative Defenses—Burden of   Proof, should be given. See PIK 4" .

The first paragraph of this instruction may be modified by inserting “and”   between “self-defense” and “the defense of another person.” However, the second paragraph must be   modified by inserting the word “or” between “(himself)(herself)” and “(someone else)” to make it clear that      "      2012      "      2012      the jury may find justification as self-defense alone or as the defense of another person alone and need not   find both justifications. State v. Scott, 271 Kan. 103, 115, 21 P.3d 516 (2001).      K.S.A. 21-5231 provides that a person is not justified in using force against a law enforcement officer   who “was acting in the performance of such officer’s official duties and the officer identified the officer’s   self in accordance with any applicable law or the person using force knew or reasonably should have   known that the person was a law enforcement officer.” Thus, in the appropriate case, the last bracketed   paragraph of the instruction, numbered 3, should be included in the instruction.      Comment      In State v. Hundley, 236 Kan. 461, 693 P.2d 475 (1985), the Court disapproved PIK—Criminal 2d   54.17 in the use of “immediate” in lieu of the statutory “imminent.” The Court held it to be reversible   error to use the word “immediate” in the self-defense instruction in that it places undue emphasis on the   immediate action of the aggressor whereas the nature of the buildup of terror and fear which had been   going on over a period of time, particularly in battered spouse instances, may be most relevant. The word   “imminent” would describe this defense more accurately, as the definition implies “impending or near at   hand, rather than immediate.” See also State v. Hodges, 239 Kan. 63, 716 P.2d 563 (1986).

Comment      The fact that the defendant in an action for damages for assault and battery was actuated by malice in   striking the plaintiff will not sustain a verdict for punitive damages when no actual damages are awarded.

FALSE ARREST      <h4><a name='127.20' href='127.20'>127.20</a></h4><p>FALSE ARREST OR IMPRISONMENT DEFINED      (False imprisonment) (False arrest) is the restraint of the personal   freedom of an individual without legal excuse by any words, acts, threats, or   personal violence that under the circumstances the one being restrained fears   to disregard.      Notes on Use      In most intentional tort cases, actions for false imprisonment will be joined with assault and battery.   The action of false imprisonment always includes the elements of an assault in the technical sense. If the   assault is combined with battery, it does not change the character of the action, but merely serves to affect   the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff.      Comment      The nature and character of the action of false imprisonment are discussed in Comer v. Knowles, 17   Kan. 436 (1877). The Comer v. Knowles case was followed in Perry v. Kress & Co., 187 Kan. 537, 358 P.2d   665 (1961); Cordell v. Standard Oil Co., 131 Kan. 221, 289 P. 472 (1930); Gariety v. Fleming, 121 Kan. 42,   45, 245 P. 1054 (1926); Thompson v. General Finance Co., Inc.,, 205 Kan. 76, 468 P.2d 269 (1970); and   Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972). It is essential that the restraint be against   the plaintiff's will; and “ ‘if one agrees of one’s own free choice to surrender freedom of motion, as by   remaining in a room or accompanying another voluntarily, to clear oneself of suspicion or to accommodate   the desires of the other, rather than yielding to the constraint of a threat, then there is no imprisonment.’ “   Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts (Sth ed.) p 49 § 11 quoted in Wright v. Montgomery Ward & Co.,   Inc., 814 F. Supp. 986, 989 (D. Kan. 1993), aff'd 25 F.3d 1059 (10th Cir. 1994).      Damages for fright, nervousness, and mental anguish may be recovered where the plaintiff was   unlawfully imprisoned. It is for the jury to set the amount. Cordell v. Standard Oil Co., 131 Kan. 221, 289   P. 472 (1930).     Malice and willfulness are not essential elements of false arrest or false imprisonment, and the   motives of the defendant, whatever they may have been, are not material so far as a right of action is   concerned, and can never be material except where something more than compensatory damages are   sought. If exemplary damages are sought, proof of malice in making the arrest or in imposing the restraint   is competent. Lemmon v. King, 95 Kan. 524, 148 P. 750 (1915); Garnier v. Squires, 62 Kan. 321, 324, 62 P.   1005 (1900).     PIK 2d 14.20 [PIK 4" ] and the comments thereunder on malice and willfulness were approved   in Thompson v. General Finance Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 76, 468 P.2d 269 (1970).      The Kansas Supreme Court cites with approval PIK 2d 14.20 [PIK 4" ] in Munsell v. Ideal   Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972).

However, (he) (she) must take some active part in causing the arrest.

Notes on Use      This instruction should be given in addition to PIK 4" , False Arrest or Imprisonment Defined,   when there is a dispute whether the defendant directed, requested, commanded or otherwise caused the   plaintiff s arrest. Use the applicable bracketed paragraph.      Comment      One who seeks to recover for false arrest must prove the unlawful arrest by defendant and, though   it is not necessary that the defendant directly order the arrest, it must appear that the defendant either   instigated it, assisted in it, or by some means directed or encouraged it. Thurman v. Cundiff, 2 Kan. App. 2d   406, 580 P.2d 893 (1978).     What is direction or instigation sufficient to impose liability on a private citizen depends upon the   facts of each case. It may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Zd.     The mere giving of information to a law officer tending to show that a crime has been committed is   not enough to render the informer liable for a false imprisonment by the officer.

A legal excuse exists when a law enforcement officer arrests a person   under any of the following circumstances:      [The officer has a warrant commanding that the person be arrested.]      [The officer has probable cause to believe that a warrant for the person’s   arrest has been issued in this state or in another jurisdiction for a felony   committed therein. |      [The officer has probable cause to believe that the person is committing   or has committed a felony. |      [The officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed   a misdemeanor and further has probable cause to believe:      (The person will not be apprehended or evidence of the crime will     be irretrievably lost unless the person is immediately arrested;)     (The person may cause injury to himself or others or damage to     property unless (he) (she) is immediately arrested;)     (The person has intentionally inflicted bodily harm to another     person.)|     [Any crime, except a traffic infraction, has been or is being committed in     the officer’s view.]      Probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances within the arresting   officer’s knowledge and of which (he) (she) has reasonably trustworthy   information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable   caution to believe that an offense has been committed and, if required, that   additional circumstances exist justifying the arrest.      Notes on Use      If the alleged restraint was by a merchant or his employee who had reasonable grounds for believing   the person restrained was committing the offense of shoplifting, see PIK 4" , Detention for   Shoplifting—Merchant’s Defense.      Comment      As pointed out in State v. Flummerfelt, 235 Kan. 609, 612, 684 P.2d 363 (1984), prior to adoption of   the Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure in 1970, the limits of a law enforcement officer’s power to arrest      2012                   had not been statutorily defined. K.S.A. 22-2401 specifies the authority of a law enforcement officer to   arrest, and the statute is set forth in substance in this instruction.     If the defendant relies upon lawful arrest as a legal excuse, the burden is upon the defendant to prove   that such arrest was lawful.      A private person arrests without a warrant at his peril, and unless it can be shown that a felony has   actually been committed, an action for false imprisonment will lie. Garnier v. Squires, 62 Kan. 321, 62 P.   1005 (1900).     Probable cause for making an arrest is a complete defense to an action for unlawful arrest. When a   party alleges that he was arrested without a warrant, that he was tried and found guilty in police court, and   that the action was dismissed after an appeal to the district court, he fails to state a cause of action because   a judgment of conviction in a police court obtained without perjury, fraud, or corruption is a conclusive   determination that there was probable cause for the arresting officer to believe the defendant guilty of the   alleged offense. Hill v. Day, 168 Kan. 604, 215 P.2d 219 (1950).      In Alvarado v. City of Dodge City, 238 Kan. 48, 708 P.2d 174 (1985), an action for false arrest, it   was held error to fail to instruct on probable cause where the merchant’s defense (K.S.A. 21-3424[c])   [now K.S.A. 21-5411(d)] was asserted, which permits detention on probable cause to believe shoplifting   has occurred or is about to. See PIK 4" . Probable cause is the basis of the legal excuse set forth in   paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this instruction. The definition of probable cause as reasonable belief is adapted   from State v. Abu-Isba, 235 Kan. 851, 854, 685 P.2d 856 (1984).     In an action for false arrest by police officers acting without a warrant, it was held that, under Kansas   law, the determination of probable cause at a preliminary hearing is prima facie evidence of probable cause   to arrest, which may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence. Thompson v. City of Lawrence,   Kansas, 58 F.3d 1511 (10th Cir. 1995).      "      2016      "      2012      <h4><a name='127.23' href='127.23'>127.23</a></h4><p>DETENTION FOR SHOPLIFTING—MERCHANT?’S DEFENSE      Any merchant, (his) (her) agent, or employee, who reasonably believes   that a person has actual possession of and has wrongfully taken or is about   to wrongfully take merchandise from a mercantile establishment, may detain   such person on the premises or in the immediate vicinity in a reasonable   manner and for a reasonable period of time for the purpose of investigating   the circumstances of such possession. Reasonable detention under these   circumstances does not constitute an arrest nor an unlawful restraint.      A wrongful taking is the willful obtaining or exerting of unauthorized   control over property of another with the intent to deprive the owner   permanently or temporarily of the possession, use or benefit of (his) (her)   property.     A reasonable belief exists if the facts and circumstances within the   knowledge of a merchant, (his) (her) agent or employee and of which (he)   (she) has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to   warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that merchandise has been   or is about to be wrongfully taken.      Notes on Use      K.S.A. 21-541 1(a) defines the crime of unlawful restraint. Subsection (b) provides that the statute   does not apply to acts done in the performance of duty by a law enforcement officer. Subsection (c) sets   forth the so-called merchant’s defense embodied in this instruction. In Codner v. Skaggs Drug Centers,   Inc., 224 Kan. 531, 533, 581 P.2d 387 (1978), it was held that the merchant’s defense is applicable in a   civil action for false imprisonment. This has been the law in Kansas since the enactment in 1959 of an   antecedent of K.S.A. 21-5411(c), which specifically provided the defense applied in actions for assault,   false arrest, false imprisonment, unlawful detention, defamation or slander. Theft and unlawful deprivation   of property are defined, respectively, in K.S.A. 21-5801 and 21-5803. The definition of reasonable belief is   adapted from State v. Abu-Isba, 235 Kan. 851, 854, 685 P.2d 856 (1984).      Comment      The Supreme Court in Alvarado v. City of Dodge City, 238 Kan. 48, 708 P.2d 174 (1985) (an action   in which the merchant was also a defendant), sets forth the history and social, economic and legal rationale   of the merchant’s defense along with a review of the significant Kansas decisions discussing its application.   In Alvarado, plaintiff was detained by an off-duty police officer working as a security guard for a discount   store. The Supreme Court held: (1) plaintiff had no civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because   Kansas tort actions for false imprisonment, battery and defamation provide an adequate postdeprivation   remedy sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) the   fact that the agent or employee who detains a suspected shoplifter is an off-duty law enforcement officer   does not deprive the officer or his merchant employer of the merchant’s defense; (3) using the definitions   of detention and arrest in K.S.A. 22-2202, the court held that although the officer told plaintiff he was                  "      arresting her, displayed his badge and later filed an arrest report with the police department, plaintiff was   only temporarily detained on the merchant’s premises; and (4) the trial court erred in failing to give an   instruction defining probable cause, one of the primary issues being whether the officer had probable cause   to believe the defendant had wrongfully taken merchandise from the store.       2012      "       <h4><a name='127.24' href='127.24'>127.24</a></h4><p>COMPENSATORY DAMAGES      If you find for the plaintiff, you will then determine the amount of (his)   (her) recovery. You should allow (him) (her) such amount of money as will   reasonably compensate (him) (her) for the damage resulting from the wrongful   conduct of the defendant. You may take into consideration any mental pain   and suffering, fright, nervousness, indignity, humiliation, embarrassment,   and insult to which (he) (she) was subjected, and from these as shown by the   evidence you should award such sum as will fairly and adequately compensate   (him) (her). The amount to be awarded rests within your sound discretion.      The total amount of your verdict cannot exceed $ , the amount of   the plaintiff’s claim.      Notes on Use      See PIK 4" , Punitive Damages, if punitive damages are involved and PIK 4"  for a   definition of malice.      Comment   If exemplary damages are sought, proof of malice in making an arrest or in imposing restraint is   competent. Garnier v. Squires, 62 Kan. 321, 62 P. 1005 (1900).      Evidence of wealth is competent on the question of punitive damages. Hammargren v. Montgomery   Ward & Co., 172 Kan. 484, 241 P.2d 1192 (1952).      The Supreme Court suggested that PIK 2d 14.22 [PIK 4" ] be followed in an action for false   imprisonment in Munsell v.

MALICIOUS PROSECUTION      <h4><a name='127.30' href='127.30'>127.30</a></h4><p>ELEMENTS OF ACTION      To maintain an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must prove   that the defendant (procured) (initiated) (continued) the proceeding of which   complaint is made, that the defendant in so doing acted without probable   cause and with malice, and that the proceeding terminated in favor of the   plaintiff.      Notes on Use      For malice defined, see PIK 4" .     For an explanation of procuring a proceeding, see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 674, comment b,   and § 653, comment f.

General Finance Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 76,   468 P.2d 269 (1970); and Stohr v. Donahue, 215 Kan. 528, 527 P.2d 983 (1974).      The discharge of an accused by an examining magistrate “should be regarded as tending to show   want of probable cause, and, therefore, as being sufficient to place upon the defendant the burden of   showing its existence.” Tucker v. Bartlett, 97 Kan. 163, 164, 155 P. 1 (1916). The burden of proving the   want of probable cause, however, is upon the plaintiff who alleges it. Eckl v. Brennan, 150 Kan. 502, 504,   95 P.2d 535 (1939).      The finding of probable cause by a magistrate in a criminal felony proceeding is only prima facie   evidence of probable cause. Thompson v. General Finance Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 76, 468 P.2d 269 (1970).   In an action for malicious prosecution based on the initiation of a proceeding, the inquiry as to want or   existence of probable cause is limited to the facts and circumstances that were apparent at the time the   proceeding was commenced. Facts learned at a preliminary trial may not be considered. Atchison, T. & S. F.   R. Co. v. Watson, 37 Kan. 773, 15 P. 877 (1887); Messinger v. Fulton, 173 Kan. 851, 252 P.2d 904 (1953).   However, if a person properly initiates a suit, that person could still be held liable for malicious prosecution   for wrongfully continuing the suit if it becomes apparent that probable cause is lacking. Miskew v. Hess,   21 Kan. App. 2d 927, 933, 910 P.2d 223 (1996). See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 674, comment c.      "      2014      "      2014      The prosecution of a person by one with any other motive than to bring the guilty person to justice   is malicious prosecution. Malice is not restricted to personal hatred, spite, or revenge. It is sufficient if the   prosecution was instituted with any wrongful or improper motive. Foltz v. Buck, 89 Kan. 381, 385, 131 P.   587 (1913); Blakely v. Roanoke State Bank, 122 Kan. 810, 253 P. 544 (1927).     Damages may be recovered for the malicious prosecution of a civil suit. The action differs from an   action for damages for abuse of process. Ahring v. White, 156 Kan. 60, 131 P.2d 699 (1942); Jackson &   Scherer, Inc. v. Washburn, 209 Kan. 321, 496 P.2d 1358 (1972). Different elements enter into actions for   malicious prosecution than enter into actions for false imprisonment. Sharp v. Cox, 158 Kan. 253, 146 P.2d   410 (1944).     Although in some particulars there may be distinctions between actions based upon malicious   prosecution of civil actions and malicious prosecution of criminal actions, essentials of proof for recovery   are the same. Barnes v. Danner, 169 Kan. 32, 216 P.2d 804 (1950). See also Bratton v. Exchange State   Bank, 129 Kan. 82, 281 P. 857 (1929), citing authority to the effect that an action must have terminated   in a plaintiff's favor and holding that the abandonment of a cause of action by filing an amended and   supplemental petition arising out of the same subject matter is such a termination as will lay a foundation   for an action of malicious prosecution.     For an action of malicious prosecution based upon lunacy and commitment proceedings, see Eckl v.   Brennan, 150 Kan. 502, 95 P.2d 535 (1939); and Dick v. Truck Insurance Exchange, 386 F.2d 145 (10" Cir.   1967).      “In order to recover plaintiff must show that the defendant was responsible for the institution or   continuance of the original proceeding of which complaint is made.” Barnes v. Danner, 169 Kan. 32, 216   P.2d 804 (1950).     The substance of PIK 2d 14.30, 14.31, 14.32, 14.33 and 14.34 [PIK 4" , , ,    and ] were approved in Silva v. Lewis, 210 Kan. 348, 502 P.2d 831 (1972).     The substance of PIK 2d 14.30, 14.31, and 14.32 [PIK 4" ,  and ] were approved   in Thompson v. General Finance Co., Inc., 205 Kan. 76, 468 P.2d 269 (1970).      The liability of an attorney who initiates a civil proceeding on behalf of his client or who takes any   steps in the proceeding without probable cause or for improper purposes is clearly enunciated in Nelson v.   Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607 P.2d 438 (1980).     An attorney cannot be held liable for the consequences of his professional negligence to his client’s   adversary. The remedy provided to a third-party adversary is solely through an action for malicious   prosecution. Id.      In Nelson v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607 P.2d 438 (1980), the court adopted the Restatement definition   of favorable termination: “Civil proceedings may be terminated in favor of the person against whom they   are brought by (1) the favorable adjudication of the claim by a competent tribunal, or (2) the withdrawal of   the proceedings by the person bringing them, or (3) the dismissal of the proceedings because of his failure   to prosecute them. A favorable adjudication may be by judgment rendered by a court after trial, or upon   demurrer or its equivalent.” 227 Kan. at 280, (citing Restatement Torts § 674, comment j).     A termination of a case based on a statute of limitations defense will not constitute a favorable   termination for purposes of a malicious prosecution action. Miskew v. Hess, 21 Kan.

Noah, 266 Kan. 829, 974 P.2d 520 (1999), the court adopted the principle of   Restatement (Second) of Torts § 675 (1977) that a lawyer who initiates an action “has probable cause for   doing so if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and ... (a)   correctly or reasonably believes that under those facts the claim may be valid under the applicable law.” As   stated in Comment d, he need not have the same degree of certainty as to the relevant facts that is required   of a private prosecutor of criminal proceedings: “[I]t is enough if their existence is not certain but [the   lawyer] believes he can establish their existence to the satisfaction of court and jury.”                              "      In Wilkinson v. Shoney’s, Inc., 269 Kan. 194, 4 P.3d 1149 (2000), where plaintiff sought damages   for malicious defense of an unemployment compensation claim, the Supreme Court, following the great   weight of national authority, refused to recognize a new cause of action for malicious defense, citing Baxter   v.

There may   be malice without probable cause and there may be probable cause without   malice. You may not infer that a person who acted with malice acted either   with or without probable cause, but you may infer that a person who acted   without probable cause acted with malice. That is to say, want of probable   cause may be evidence of malice, but malice is not evidence of either probable   cause or the want of probable cause.

Notes on Use      Good faith reliance on the advice of counsel rebuts the allegation of want of probable cause, and this   is so whether the action is for malicious prosecution of a criminal charge or a civil action.      Comment      This defense has been recognized in Kansas at least since Schippel v. Norton, 38 Kan. 567, 16 P. 804   (1888). An extended recitation of the principles applicable in an action for malicious prosecution appears   in Nelson v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607 P.2d 438 (1980). The analysis of Nelson is repeated and applied in   Sampson v. Hunt, 233 Kan. 572, 665 P.2d 743 (1983), and Hunt v. Dresie, 241 Kan. 647, 740 P.2d 1046   (1987).     The defense of reliance on the advice of counsel is available in an action for malicious prosecution of   a civil suit to the same extent and upon the same principle as in an action based upon a criminal prosecution.   Carnegie v. Gage Furniture, Inc., 217 Kan. 564, 538 P.2d 659 (1975); Nelson v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607   P.2d 438 (1980), Restatement of Torts (Second) § 675, comment g.     In Hunt v. Dresie, 241 Kan. 647, 659, 740 P.2d 1046 (1987), the elements of the defense of advice of   counsel in a civil proceeding are set forth. The authority cited, 72 Am. Jur. 2d, Malicious Prosecution § 174,   quotes the elements from an opinion in an action for a malicious criminal prosecution in which defendant   claimed the defense of advice of private counsel. (Monaghan v. Cox, 155 Mass. 487, 489 30 N.E. 467, 468   (1892)).     When a malicious prosecution action is brought against an attorney, in determining probable cause   the jury may properly consider not only those facts disclosed to the attorney by the client but also those   which could have been learned by a diligent effort on the attorney’s part. Nelson v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271,   284, 607 P.2d 438 (1980).     Under the rule stated in Restatement (Second) of Torts § 653, which imposes liability upon a private   person who procures institution of criminal proceedings against another not guilty if done without probable   cause and primarily for a purpose other than that of bringing an offender to justice, when a private person   gives to a prosecuting attorney information that he believes to be true and the prosecuting attorney in   the exercise of his uncontrolled discretion initiates criminal proceedings based upon that information, the   informer is not liable even though the information proves to be false and his belief was one that a reasonable   man would not entertain. Comment g. In Hunt v. Dresie, 241 Kan. 647, , 740 P.2d 1046 (1987), it   was said the prosecuting attorney’s responsibility completely supersedes that of the complainant in the   ordinary case, since the prosecuting attorney alone is responsible for deciding whether criminal charges   should be filed.       2014      "      2014      In Bartal v. Brower, 268 Kan. 195, 993 P.2d 629 (1999), a malicious prosecution action by a surgeon   against plaintiffs and their attorneys in a malpractice action which had been voluntarily dismissed as to   the surgeon prior to trial, summary judgment against the surgeon was affirmed, the court holding that   plaintiffs reasonably relied upon advice of counsel in filing the malpractice claim against the surgeon,   having disclosed to them all material facts, and their attorneys had sufficient information, based upon   medical records and expert opinion, to determine probable cause, applying the standard set forth in Nelson   v. Miller, 227 Kan. 271, 607 P.2d 438 (1980), to commence an action based upon lack of informed consent   and medical negligence.

That the other party reasonably relied and acted upon the   representations made.      5. That the other party sustained damage by relying upon   them.      A representation is material when it relates to some matter that is so   substantial as to influence the party to whom it was made.      Notes on Use      Burden of proof is by clear and convincing evidence. See PIK 4" .      Comment      Essential elements of fraud are stated in Alires v. McGehee, 277 Kan. 398, 85 P.3d 1191 (2004); Sipes   v. Crum, 204 Kan. 591, 464 P.2d 1 (1970); and Minnesota Ave., Inc. v. Automatic Packagers, Inc., 211 Kan.   461, 507 P.2d 268 (1973).     To constitute actionable fraud the representation must relate to past or present fact, as opposed to   mere opinions or puffing or promised actions in the future. Timi v. Prescott State Bank, 220 Kan. 377, 553   P.2d 315 (1976). Actionable fraud may be based upon a suppression of facts that the party is under a legal   or equitable obligation to communicate and in respect of which he could not be innocently silent. DuShane   v. Union Nat’l Bank, 223 Kan. 755, 576 P.2d 674 (1978).     One of the essential elements of actionable fraud is reliance thereon by the party to whom the   misrepresentation was made, to his detriment. Nichols v.

To constitute fraud by silence the plaintiff must prove:      1. The defendant has knowledge of material facts which   plaintiff did not have and which the plaintiff could not have   discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence;      2. The defendant was under an obligation to communicate   the material facts to the plaintiff;      3. The defendant intentionally failed to communicate to   plaintiff the material facts;      4. The plaintiff justifiably relied upon the defendant to   communicate the material facts to the plaintiff; and      5. The plaintiff sustained damages as a result of the   defendant’s failure to communicate this to the plaintiff.      A fact is material if it is one to which a reasonable man would attach   importance in determining (his) (her) choice of action in the transaction in   question.      A party is justified in relying without investigation upon another to   communicate the facts material to a transaction unless (he) (she) knows or   has reason to know of facts which make (his) (her) reliance unreasonable.      Notes on Use      This instruction replaces PIK 4 , Fraud—Elements, where the claim of fraud is the result of   silence rather than false representations.

DuShane v. Union   Nat’l Bank, 223 Kan. 755, 576 P.2d 674 (1978).      A defrauded party would not be deprived of relief because he had the opportunity to investigate when   his lack of knowledge was such that the investigation would disclose nothing to him. Wolf v. Brungardt, 215   Kan. 272, 524 P.2d 726 (1974).     The definition of justifiable reliance is quoted in Goff v. American Savings Association, 1 Kan.

Byers Construction Co., 212 Kan. 65, 73, 510   P.2d 198 (1973). See City of Wichita, Kan. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 72 F.3d 1491, 1495 (10th Cir. 1996) where   the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded because the trial court specified to the jury   what should be determined a “material fact.” In addition to the PIK 2d 14.42 [PIK 4" ] definition   of a material fact, the trial court also included an instruction stating the City had to prove that defendants   concealed or misrepresented “material facts concerning unreasonable health hazards.” The City objected to   this instruction and the Court of Appeals found that the district court had “invaded the province of the jury   by pre-determining which fact a reasonable person could deem important.” Id., 72 F.3d at 1495.     Jury instructions given by the trial court are approved if the instructions “properly and fairly state   the law as applied to the facts in the case.” Modification of PIK 2d 14.42 [PIK 4" ] (concerning   when a party may justifiably rely without investigation upon another to communicate the facts material to   a transaction) was proper when a contract between a buyer and a seller imposed on the buyer the duty to   inspect and rely on his own inspection rather than on seller’s express or implied representations.

The promisor (defendant) had no intention of performing   (his) (her) promise at the time (he) (she) made it;      2. The promisor (defendant) did not perform (his) (her)   promise as (he) (she) represented that (he) (she) would;      3. The promisor (defendant) made the promise with the   intent to deceive and for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to   act upon the promise;      4. The plaintiff reasonably relied and acted upon the   promise;      5. The plaintiff sustained damages relying upon the promise   of the promisor (defendant).      Notes on Use      This instruction should only be given when the alleged fraud relates to promises or statements   concerning future events.      Comment      This instruction is based on the theory that a person’s intention or belief is a matter of fact, and that if   a misrepresentation is made with regard thereto, the misrepresentation is one of fact. The gravamen in such   a case is not the breach of the agreement to perform, but the fraudulent representation concerning a present,   existing intention not to perform. Edwards v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 187 Kan. 656, 360 P.2d 23 (1961).     If when the representations are made respecting what is to be done in the future there is no real   intention on the part of the person making such a representation to do in the future the thing represented,   the then existing false intention is sufficient to form the basis of liability for false representation. Olsburg   State Bank v. Anderson, 154 Kan. 511, 119 P.2d 515 (1941).     A more effective way of enforcing a promise to perform some act in the future rather than on the   “fraudulent promise” theory is by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel. See Marker v.

The person supplying the false information failed   to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or   communicating the false information; and,      2. The person who relies upon the information is (the person   or one of a group of persons for whose benefit and guidance the   information is supplied) (a person or one of a group of persons to   whom the person supplying the information knew the information   would be communicated by another); and,      3. The damages are suffered in (a transaction that the person   supplying the information intends to influence or in a substantially   similar transaction) (a transaction that the person supplying the   information knew that another intended to influence).      Notes on Use      This instruction is applicable when there is no intent to deceive but only good faith coupled with   negligence. The duty imposed is exercise of the care or competence of a reasonable man in obtaining or   communicating the information. What is reasonable is, as in other cases of negligence, dependent upon the   circumstances.     Alternatives respecting the person for or to whom the information is obtained or communicated   are supplied in parentheses in paragraph 2 because liability attaches if the maker of the representation   knows that his recipient intends to transmit the information to a similar person, persons or group. The   second alternative in parentheses in paragraph 3 is applicable in combination with the second alternative in   brackets in paragraph 2.     If there is a public duty to give the information, liability extends to loss suffered by any member of   the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created in any transaction in which it is intended to protect   them.      Comment      In Mahler v. Keenan Real Estate, Inc., 255 Kan. 593, 605, 876 P.2d 609 (1994), the court held that   a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation as defined in Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552 (1976)   is recognized in Kansas. This instruction is adapted from the Restatement. See the opinion in Mahler for a   discussion of prior Kansas decisions upon which the court’s holding is based.      2012                   "      In FDX Supply Chain Services v.

The   tort only applies to cases of misrepresentation of factual, commercial information, not to statements of   future intent.” Bittel v. Farm Svcs. of Central Kansas, P.C_A., 265 Kan. 651, 962 P.2d 491 (1998). Whether   misrepresentations are of present fact or of opinion or future intent is a question of law. /d. at 665.

On a theory of negligent misrepresentation, the chiropractor provided information to the   insurance company and not the plaintiff and under Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552 was liable only to   the insurance company for failure to exercise reasonable care.      2012      "      2012      E.

In Kansas, these principles have been   incorporated into the law of defamation generally, meaning that a private plaintiff   may not recover punitive or presumed damages regardless of whether the defendant   is a member of the media protected by the First Amendment. In the three Gobin   decisions (Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co., 216 Kan. 223, 531 P.2d 76 (1975),   appeal after remand 229 Kan. 1, 620 P.2d 1163 (1980), appeal after remand 232   Kan. 1, 649 P.2d 1239 (1982) [Gobin I]; Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co., 229 Kan.   1, 620 P.2d 1163 (1980) appeal after remand 232 Kan. 1, 649 P.2d 1239 (1982)   [Gobin IT]; Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co., 232 Kan. 1, 649 P.2d 1239 (1982)   [Gobin ITT]), the law of Kansas was reinterpreted in light of Gertz v. Robert Welch,   Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974), and other United   States Supreme Court decisions. The change in the law is explained in Gobin TIT:   “Prior to Gertz, Kansas followed the common-law rule dividing libel into libel per   se and libel per quod. Libel per se involved words from which malice was implied   and damage was conclusively presumed to result. General damages from such a   publication arose by inference of law and the plaintiff was not obligated to establish   damage by proof.... Gertz, as we pointed out in Gobin I, effected an immediate   change upon the rule in Kansas and in those other states which presumed damages   upon the establishment of libel per se, and permitted recovery based upon that   presumption. Damages recoverable for defamation may no longer be presumed;   they must be established by proof, no matter what the character of the libel.” 232   Kan. at 4-5. In a defamation action by a private person, punitive damages may   not be recovered under any standard less demanding than actual malice as defined   in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686   (1964).      Gertz was an action by a private individual against a media defendant. The   United States Supreme Court was balancing the interest of the states in compensating   private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation against the need for “a   vigorous and uninhibited press” protected by the First Amendment. A majority of   state courts have held “where only a private plaintiff and non-media defendant are   involved, the common law standard [of damages presumed upon establishment   of libel per se and recovery of punitive damages] does not threaten the free and   robust debate of public issues or a meaningful dialogue about self-government, or                              "      freedom of the press,” and have refused “to extend the Gertz holding to actions   between a private individual and a non-media defendant.” Vinson v. Linn-Mar   Community School Dist., 360 N.W.2d 108, 118 (lowa 1984).      In Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U.S. 749, 105 S. Ct.   2939, 86 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1985), the court affirmed the interpretation of Gertz   adopted by some state courts that where the defamed party is a private person   and the action is against a non-media defendant, the legitimate state interest in   compensation of individuals harmed by defamatory falsehood is not outweighed   by the First Amendment values protected in Sullivan and Gertz. “In light of the   reduced constitutional value of speech involving no matters of public concern, we   hold that the state interest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive   damages—even absent a showing of ‘actual malice.’ “ (105 S. Ct. at 2946.)      “Lower federal courts and state courts have differed in their   conclusions as to what level of fault must be shown by private   plaintiffs after Dun & Bradstreet. The case has been cited for   the proposition that a private figure plaintiff must prove at least   negligence to recover any damages. Other courts have noted that,   in view of the Dun & Bradstreet holding, it is questionable whether   the fault requirement mandated by Gertz survives. Still other courts   have concluded that the Dun & Bradstreet case left open the question   whether strict liability was a constitutionally permissible standard in   cases of private figures not involving issues of public concern.     “Finally, other courts have interpreted Dun and Bradstreet as   indicating that the constitution thus imposes no minimum standard   of fault in private plaintiff/private concern cases; states may choose   whether to impose liability without fault in such cases. Under such an   approach, the elimination of the fault requirement in cases involving   private individuals and matters not of public concern was implied in   Dun & Bradstreet, because the state interest in allowing presumed   fault is of similar weight as the state interest in presumed damages.”     50 Am. Jur. 2d, Libel and Slander § 98.     In Polson v. Davis, 895 F.2d 705 (10th Cir. 1990), the court considered   whether Kansas continues to recognize defamation per se, which does not require   proof of actual damages. The court cited Gobin II and the statement quoted   above that after Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41   L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974), “Damages recoverable for defamation may no longer be   presumed; they must be established by proof, no matter what the character.” It   was noted that subsequent to Gobin III, the United States Supreme Court had   limited Gertz to actions against media defendants and actions involving public   issues on the basis that First Amendment freedoms were not at risk in actions   by private individuals against non-media defendants, as discussed above. Dun &   Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U.S. 749, 105 S. Ct. 2939, 86 L. Ed.   2d 593 (1985). Plaintiff argued that Dun & Bradstreet revealed Gobin III to be a   needlessly overbroad reading of Gertz. The court declined to “correct” the law in   Kansas, saying that Dun & Bradstreet was only permissive and did not require      2012      "       as a constitutional matter a presumption of damages in defamation per se cases   involving non-media defendants or issues not of public concern. The 10th Circuit   Court of Appeals then states: “[T]he Kansas Supreme Court, although recognizing   the opportunity in Turner v. Halliburton Co., 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106 (1986),   has declined to reexamine the scope of its Gobin holding.” 895 F.2d at 708.      In point of fact, the court in Turner did not reconsider its holding in Gobin II   because it found it unnecessary to do so in the circumstances and left the matter for   later decision. After holding that the verdict for damages for defamation should be   overturned because there was no credible evidence of actual malice to overcome   a qualified privilege, the court said: “The judgment on the defamation issue must   be reversed. In view of the decision reached upon this issue, it is not necessary   for us to consider the question of whether Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co., 232   Kan. 1, 649 P.2d 1239 (1982), requires actual proof of damage to reputation when   the defendant is not a member of the news media. That question must be left   for another day.” 240 Kan. at 11. While Polson affirmed the trial court’s refusal   to instruct on defamation per se, the issue of whether the cause of action was   recognized in Kansas was not foreclosed.      In Zoeller v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 17 Kan. App. 2d 223, 834 P.2d   391 (1992), the Court of Appeals undertook to resolve finally the impact of Gertz v.   Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974), upon the   Kansas law of defamation. Where Turner v. Halliburton Co. left open the door on   whether Gobin IT should be read as authority that a private individual must prove   actual damage to reputation in a defamation action against a non-media defendant,   in Zoeller v. American Family Ins. Co. the court slammed the door in plaintiff s   face. Ruling precisely on the issue, the court of appeals concluded that the holding   of Gobin III that damage to reputation was “an essential ingredient” of an action   for defamation compelled the conclusion that Kansas no longer permits recovery   based upon establishment of slander per se. The court notes Dun & Bradstreet,   Inc., and Turner and finds “tenuous” the conclusion in Polson v. Davis, 895 F.2d   705 (10th Cir. 1990), that the Kansas Supreme Court had declined in Turner to   reconsider the scope of Gobin III in light of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., and agrees   that, in dicta, the court in Turner seemed to open the door again on the issue of   recognition of defamation per se. Nonetheless, the court found itself constrained   by Gobin III and a later decision, Knudsen v. Kansas Gas & Electric Co., 248 Kan.   469, 807 P.2d 71 (1991), which simply quotes Gobin IIT in a decision that turns   upon plaintiff s status as a limited public figure required to prove actual malice.   (Knudsen cites Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. as permitting recovery of actual and punitive   damages absent a showing of actual malice when the defamatory statements do not   involve a matter of public concern.) The court states that if the question of the   application of the rule of Gobin III to an action by a private individual against a   non-media defendant has not in fact been answered, the Kansas Supreme Court   would decide that Kansas no longer permits recovery based upon defamation per   se. See Ali v. Douglas Cable Communications, 929 F. Supp. 1362, 1384 (D. Kan.   1996); Pfannenstiel v. Osborne Publishing Co., 939 F. Supp. 1497, 1501 (D. Kan.   1996).      2012       "      In Moran v. State, 267 Kan. 583, 985 P.2d 127 (1999), the court, without citing   Zoeller, stated, “This court has not squarely decided whether in Kansas any and   all defamation plaintiffs must allege and prove actual damages.” The court further   stated, “Gertz changed the law in Kansas. Damages recoverable for defamation ...   could no longer be presumed but must be proven,” which is the holding, without   attribution, in Gobin IIT. It would appear that the question reserved in Turner v.   Halliburton Co., 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106 (1986), whether actual damages to   reputation must be proved in an action for defamation by a private citizen against   a non-media defendant, has still not been answered.      Actual malice under the principle of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376   U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964), is a different concept from the   traditional concept of express malice as defined in PIK 4" . “The definition   of the term ‘actual malice,’ when used as a constitutional requirement, has been   criticized as illogical because the requirement has no connection with malice in its   usual sense of ill will.” 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Libel and Slander § 4. Malice as defined in   PIK 4"  was referred to by the United States Supreme Court in Rosenbloom   v. Metromedia, 403 U.S. 29,21 S. Ct. 1811, 29 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971), as “common   law malice.” Actual malice refers to a constitutional standard that is something   other than malice in its usual sense of ill will. It is a term of art meaning knowledge   of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.      The distinction between actual malice and common-law malice is noted in   Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, , 11 S. Ct. 2419, 115   L. Ed. 2d 447 (1991). “Actual malice under the New York Times standard should   not be confused with the concept of malice as an evil intent or a motive arising   from spite or ill will. See Greenbelt Pub. Assn. v. Bresler, 398 U.S. 6, 90 S. Ct.   1537, 26 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1970). We have used the term actual malice as a shorthand   to describe the First Amendment protections for speech injurious to reputation....   But the term can confuse as well as enlighten. In this respect, the phrase may be   an unfortunate one. See Harte-Hanks Communications v. Connaughton, 491 U.S.   657, 666, 109 S. Ct. 2678, 105 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1989). In place of the term actual   malice, it is better practice that jury instructions refer to publication of a statement   with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth or falsity.”       2012      "      2020      <h4><a name='127.51' href='127.51'>127.51</a></h4><p>DEFAMATION      Defamation is communication to a person of false information tending   to (expose another living person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule) (deprive   another of the benefits of public confidence and social acceptance) (degrade and   vilify the memory of one who is dead and to scandalize or provoke [his] [her]   surviving relatives and friends).      Notes on Use      This instruction has been modified to eliminate malice as an element of defamation. If the defendant   asserts conditional privilege, malice is considered. See PIK 4" , Qualified or Conditional Privilege.      Comment      The definition of defamation in the instruction is drawn from the definition of criminal false   communication in K.S.A. 21-6103 and based on a statement in Jerald v. Houston, 124 Kan. 657, 662, 261   P. 851 (1927), that whatever is punishable as libel may be the basis of a civil action of tort and that when   taken over into the law of torts, the definition of the criminal statute is merely an authoritative statement of   the meaning of the term libel. The criminal statute does not make a distinction between libel and slander.   Such common law classification relates only to the manner in which the wrongful act is committed and   appears to be unnecessary. The modern concept is that either conduct gives rise to an actionable claim   termed defamation, and the same rules of law are applicable to each. Luttrell v. United Telephone System,   Inc., 9 Kan. App. 2d 620, 683 P.2d 1292 (1984), aff’d 236 Kan. 710, 695 P.2d 1279 (1985).     The instruction accords with Restatement (Second) of Torts § 559, comments b and c (1977).      In Lindemuth v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 19 Kan. App. 2d 95, 103, 864 P.2d 744 (1993), the   court cited PIK 2d 14.51 (1992 Supp.) [PIK 4" ] with approval, noting that malice is not a necessary   element of defamation unless it is first decided that such proof is required based upon the particular facts of   the case.     “The elements of [defamation] include false and defamatory words (Hein v. Lacy, 228 Kan. 249, 616   P.2d 277 [1980]) communicated to a third person (Schulze v. Coykendall, 218 Kan. 653, 657, 545 P.2d 392   [1976]) which result in harm to the reputation of the person defamed. Gobin v.

If you find under all the facts and   circumstances that defendant(s) (was) (were) negligent in (publishing)   (broadcasting) the defamatory words and that the (publication) (broadcast)   resulted in injury to plaintiff s reputation, you should award (him) (her) such   amount as will compensate (him) (her) for the damages sustained.      A publisher or broadcaster is negligent when (he) (she) fails to observe   that standard of care which would be observed by a reasonably careful   publisher or broadcaster in the community or in similar communities under   the existing circumstances.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given in an action against a publisher or broadcaster when the plaintiff is   a private individual and only actual damages from injury to reputation are sought.      Comment      A private individual (one not a public official or a public figure) may recover damages for defamation   by a media defendant based upon negligent publication of the defamatory statement. Gobin v. Globe   Publishing Co., 216 Kan. 223, , 531 P.2d 76 (1975). Recovery is limited, however, to actual damages.   “(T]he private defamation plaintiff who establishes liability under a less demanding standard than the New   York Times test [actual malice] may recover compensation only for actual injury.... [W]hen liability for   defamation is based solely upon negligence the plaintiff may not recover presumed or punitive damages.”   Id. at 231, 233. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964),   held that a public official is prohibited from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his   official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice, that is, with knowledge   that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.      Ruling on an issue of first impression in Kansas, the Court of Appeals in Wright v. Bachmurski,   29 Kan. App. 2d 595, 29 P.3d 979, rev. denied 272 Kan. 1423 (2001), held that each communication of   a defamatory statement constitutes a new publication and gives rise to a separate cause of action against   the publisher. Two individuals who made defamatory statements to a reporter for a newspaper that then   published them were not joint tortfeasors with the newspaper and thus entitled to the benefit of a settlement   release obtained by the newspaper.      2012      "      2012      <h4><a name='127.53' href='127.53'>127.53</a></h4><p>QUALIFIED OR CONDITIONAL PRIVILEGE      A communication involving (open violations of law which justify police   interference) (matters in connection with inquiries regarding the commission of   crime) (matters which are of legitimate public concern) (information concerning   a public official) (matters involving employer-employee relations) is qualifiedly   privileged. When a communication is qualifiedly privileged, a plaintiff can   only recover by proof of actual malice on the part of the defendant.      Proof of actual malice requires a plaintiffto prove that the (communication)   (publication) was made with knowledge that the defamatory statement was   false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not and that it was   made with actual evil-mindedness or specific intent to injure.      In order for the plaintiff to recover (he) (she) must prove actual malice   by the defendant and that it defamed the plaintiff.      [Where a defamatory statement is made in good faith on any subject   matter in which the person communicating has an interest, or in reference to   which (he) (she) has a duty, and it is made to a person with a corresponding   interest or duty, the communication constitutes a qualified privilege.|      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given when qualified or conditional privilege is asserted as a defense.      Comment      For a definition and explanation of conditional or qualified privilege, see Knudsen v. Kansas Gas &   Electric Co., 248 Kan. 469, 480, 807 P.2d 71 (1991).      Privileged communications are divided into two classes, namely: absolute and conditional or   qualified. Absolutely privileged communications ordinarily pertain to officials engaged in some form of   public service or to public figures. For a discussion of who is a public figure, see Hanrahan v. Horn, 232   Kan. 531, 657 P.2d 561 (1983), and Steere v. Cupp, 226 Kan. 566, 602 P.2d 1267 (1979). Where absolute   privilege obtains, there is no liability and the court should take the case from the jury.     The question of the existence of a privilege is one of law to be determined by the court where the   evidence is undisputed. Faber v. Byrle, 171 Kan. 38, 229 P.2d 718 (1951).     In Stice v. Beacon Newspaper Corporation, 185 Kan. 61, 65, 340 P.2d 396 (1964), it was said to   be well settled that in this jurisdiction newspapers have a qualified privilege to publish as current news   all matters involving open violations of the law which justify police interference, matters in connection   with inquiries regarding the commission of a crime even though the publication may reflect on individuals   concerned and bring them into public disgrace, and information concerning the conduct of a candidate for   public office and the conduct of an incumbent public official. It was further held that a privilege rebuts the   legal inference or presumption of malice which would otherwise arise as a matter of law and places upon                              the plaintiff the burden to prove the statements were made with malice, actual evil-mindedness or specific   intent to injure.     In Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972), the court said that it was well   recognized that a communication pertaining to the reasons for discharge of a former employee is qualifiedly   privileged if made in good faith by a person having a duty in the premises to one who has a similar interest   therein. The court further held that the express malice necessary to defeat a claim of qualified privilege was   actual evil-mindedness or specific intent to injure, as set forth in Stice v. Beacon Newspaper Corporation,   185 Kan. 61, 340 P.2d 396 (1964).     See also PIK 4" , Comment Respecting the Constitutional Requirement of Actual Malice in   Defamation Cases in Kansas.     Subsequent to the decision in Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972),   the requirement of proof for recovery in a defamation action by a public official (later expanded to include   public figures) against a media defendant established in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84   S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964), was incorporated into the Kansas law of conditional privilege. New   York Times v. Sullivan requires the plaintiff to prove that the defamatory statement was made “with ‘actual   malice’, that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”   376 U.S. at 279. In Schulze v. Coykendall, 218 Kan. 653, 661, 545 P.2d 392 (1976), the court adopted the   principle that, “Proof of actual malice in defamation when a conditional privilege is found to exist requires   a plaintiff to prove that the publication was made with knowledge that the defamatory statement was false   or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”     In Hein v. Lacy, 228 Kan. 249, 616 P.2d 277 (1980), the right of a public official to recover from a non-   media defendant was explicitly measured by the actual malice standard of New York Times v. Sullivan.     For a discussion of the criteria for determining whether one charged with a crime is a limited public   figure, giving rise to a qualified privilege, see Ruebke v. Globe Communications Corp., 241 Kan. 595, 738   P.2d 1246 (1987).      In Washington Post v. Keogh, 365 F.2d 965 (D.C. Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 1011, 87 S. Ct.   708, 17 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1967), the court said of the decisions following New York Times v. Sullivan that:      “The obvious purpose of these cases is to create a rule of law more restrictive for   public official plaintiffs than the pre-7imes practice of allowing juries to infer malice from   the face of defamatory publications.... Malice, under the pre-Times practice, was equated   with hostility, vindictiveness or negligent disregard of reputation. Under the Times test   false statements made with these motives alone are not actionable; maliciousness may be   shown only through knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.”      New York Times v. Sullivan malice is a different standard of proof than evil-mindedness or intent to   injure. In Turner v. Halliburton, 240 Kan. 1, 722 P.2d 1106 (1986), where the conditional privilege arose   in circumstances of an inquiry from a prospective employer to a former employer, the court reversed a   judgment for plaintiff on the ground the evidence failed to show evil-mindedness or specific intent to injure   under the Munsell standard. The effect of Turner is to require proof of what is usually called common-law   malice as well as New York Times v. Sullivan malice. It was argued in the dissent in Turner that more and   different evidence than New York Times v. Sullivan malice was not required. In E/-Ghori v. Grimes, 23 F.   Supp. 2d 1259 (D. Kan. 1998), the court stated that actual malice is a term of art in a defamation claim   meaning the false statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether   it was false or not and, as such, is not equivalent to bad will or ill motive ordinarily associated with malice.   It was noted that in Kansas, under Turner, proof of both concepts is required where a qualified privilege   applies. Bosley v. Home Box Office, Inc., 59 F. Supp. 2d 1147 (D. Kan. 1999), notes the requirement to   overcome a qualified privilege of proof of common-law malice as well as actual malice as defined in New   York Times v. Sullivan, citing this instruction. In Dominguez v. Davidson, 266 Kan. 926, 974 P.2d 112   (1999), the court cited from Turner the dual standard of proof to overcome a qualified privilege.      "      2012      "       K.S.A. 44-119a provides that an employer who discloses information about a current or former   employee to a prospective employer shall be qualifiedly immune from civil liability and shall have absolute   immunity for the disclosure of certain specified information.      2012       "      <h4><a name='127.54' href='127.54'>127.54</a></h4><p>DEFAMATION—PROOF OF DAMAGES      If you find that the communication was defamatory and the facts and   circumstances surrounding the making of it resulted in injury and harm to   the reputation of the plaintiff, then you should award plaintiff such amount   that will compensate plaintiff for the damage the evidence shows plaintiff   sustained.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given when the plaintiff is a private individual and the defendant is a   non-media defendant, i.e., in a strictly private action for defamation. If the defendant is a publisher or   broadcaster, see PIK 4" , Negligent Defamation of Private Individual By Publisher or Broadcaster.      Comment      In Moran v. State, 267 Kan. 583, 985 P.2d 127 (1999), the court notes that Gertz v. Robert Welch,   Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974), holds that “defamation plaintiffs who do not   prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth [7.e., who fail to prove actual malice as defined   in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964)]” must be restricted   to compensation for actual injury. According to Gertz, 418 U.S. at 0, “actual injury is not limited   to out-of-pocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood   include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish   and suffering.”       2012      "      2012      <h4><a name='127.55' href='127.55'>127.55</a></h4><p>TRUTH AS DEFENSE      It is a defense to a claim of defamation if the statement made was true.

Comment      “For there to be liability for defamation, there must be a publication of a matter that is both defamatory   and false. In civil actions for libel where the defendant establishes the truth of the matter charged as   defamatory, the defendant is justified in law and exempt from all civil responsibility. Castle v. Houston,   19 Kan. 417, Syl. 2 (1877).” Ruebke v. Globe Communications Corp., 241 Kan. 595, 598, 738 P.2d 1246   (1987).     An action may lie for unwarranted invasion of right of privacy, even though the statement is   true, unless the publication of the statement is made under such circumstances which would render it a   privileged communication according to the law of libel and slander.

"      F. RIGHT OF PRIVACY      <h4><a name='127.61' href='127.61'>127.61</a></h4><p>RIGHT OF PRIVACY      The right of privacy is the right to be let alone.      In order to constitute an invasion of the right of privacy, the act must be   of such a nature that would cause mental distress or injury to a person having   ordinary feelings and intelligence.      The right of privacy is invaded if another:      [Intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude   or seclusion of another, or (his) (her) private affairs or concerns and if the   intrusion would be highly offensive to an ordinary person;]      [Appropriates to (his) (her) own use or benefit the name or likeness of   another;]      [Publicizes matters of a kind highly offensive to an ordinary man   concerning the private life of another;]      [Publicizes matters which places another before the public in a false light   of a kind highly offensive to an ordinary person. |      Notes on Use      The applicable bracketed phrase describing the nature of the invasion should be included in the   instruction.      Comment      For authority, see Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063 (1972), quoting from   Johnson v. Boeing Airplane Co., 175 Kan. 275, 262 P.2d 808 (1953). See also Kunz v. Allen, 102 Kan. 883,   172 P. 532 (1918), a case in which there was the exhibition in a moving-picture theater of the photograph   of a person taken without her consent and for the purpose of exploiting the publisher’s business, in which   it was held there was a violation of the right of privacy.     Professor Prosser believed that the law of privacy comprises four distinct kinds of torts which are   tied together by the common name, but otherwise have almost nothing in common except that each protects   against interference with the right of the plaintiff to be left alone. See Prosser, Law of Torts (4" ed.) §   117. The Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 652, has adopted Professor Prosser’s analysis of the right of   privacy.     “Kansas was among the first states to recognize an action for invasion of privacy, in Kunz v. Allen,   102 Kan. 883, 172 P. 532 (1918). That was a case of ‘appropriation of name or likeness’ and would be   classified today under the Restatement’s § 652C. Since then we have recognized causes of action for   ‘intrusion upon seclusion’ (652B) in Froelich v. Adair, supra [213 Kan. 357, 516 P.2d 993 (1973)], and      2012      "      2012      Dotson v. McLaughlin, supra [216 Kan. 201, 531 P.2d 1 (1975)]; for ‘appropriation of name or likeness’   (652C) in Johnson v. Boeing Airplane Co., 175 Kan. 275, 262 P.2d 808; and for ‘publicity given to private   life’ (652D) in Munsell v. Ideal Food Stores, 208 Kan. 909, 494 P.2d 1063. So far, it seems, all our cases   which might have been categorized as ‘publicity placing person in false light’ under 652E have been cast   by the parties in the more traditional molds of libel or slander.” Rawlins v. Hutchinson Publishing Co., 218   Kan. 295, 543 P.2d 988 (1975).      Courts generally treat false light invasion of privacy claims and defamation claims in the same way,   the difference between the two being the expanded publicity requirement in the former. To support a claim   for defamation, communication of the allegedly false information to a single third person is sufficient   publication. In a false light invasion of privacy claim, however, publication means that the matter is made   public by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded   as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge. Frye v. IBP, Inc., 15 F. Supp. 2d 1032 (D. Kan.   1998); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652D, comment a (1964).     The Supreme Court notes that the intrusion must be highly offensive to the ordinary man. Froelich   v. Werbin, 219 Kan. 461, 548 P.2d 482 (1976).     See Monroe v. Darr, 221 Kan. 281, 559 P.2d 322 (1977), which was a cause of action for invasion   of privacy by police officers by a physical intrusion upon the seclusion of a plaintiff where the Restatement   (Second) of Torts, § 652B was followed.     In Moore v. R.Z. Sims Chevrolet-Subaru, Inc., 241 Kan. 542, 738 P.2d 852 (1987), an invasion   of privacy action arising from defendant’s efforts to repossess a truck plaintiff had purchased, the court   approved PIK 2d 14.61 [antecedent of PIK 4" ] as a correct statement of the law and further approved   the following instruction which incorporates verbatim principles of law stated in Dawson v. Associates   Financial Services Co., 215 Kan. 814, 529 P.2d 104 (1974): “When one accepts credit he or she impliedly   consents for the creditor to take reasonable steps to pursue payment and recovery of secured property. The   right of a debtor to privacy is subject to the right of a creditor to take reasonable steps to collect the debt   even though the creditor’s method may result in some actual, though not actionable, invasion of privacy. In   order for an invasion of such right to be actionable, it must be of such manner and nature as to outrage or   cause mental suffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.”                  "      <h4><a name='127.62' href='127.62'>127.62</a></h4><p>CONSENT      In an action for invasion of the right of privacy, it is a defense that the   individual consented to the act. Consent may be shown from (his) (her) conduct   and the surrounding circumstances.      Comment      For authority, see Johnson v. Boeing Airplane Co., 175 Kan. 275, 262 P.2d 808 (1953), involving   trade publication of a photograph for which plaintiff voluntarily posed and did not suggest or prescribe any   restrictions on its use.       2012      "      2012      <h4><a name='127.63' href='127.63'>127.63</a></h4><p>DAMAGE ELEMENTS      If you find for the plaintiff, you will then determine the amount of (his)   (her) recovery. You should allow (him) (her) such amount of money as will   compensate (him) (her) for any mental suffering, shame or humiliation that   resulted from the occurrence in question.      The amount of your verdict may not exceed $ , the amount of   plaintiffs claim.      Comment      For authority, see Johnson v. Boeing Airplane Co., 175 Kan. 275, 262 P.2d 808 (1953), in which it   was declared, “As a general rule, recovery may be had without proof of special damage.” See also Kunz v.   Allen, 102 Kan. 883, 172 P. 532 (1918), to the same effect.                              "      G. OUTRAGEOUS AND ABUSIVE CONDUCT      <h4><a name='127.70' href='127.70'>127.70</a></h4><p>OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT CAUSING SEVERE   EMOTIONAL DISTRESS      If a defendant intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress   to the plaintiff by extreme and outrageous conduct, then that defendant is   liable to the plaintiff for the emotional distress; and, if the emotional distress   causes bodily harm, then the defendant is liable for the bodily harm thus   caused. To establish this cause of action a plaintiff must prove:      1. The defendant acted intentionally, or in reckless disregard of the   plaintiff;      2. the defendant’s conduct was extreme and outrageous;   3. the defendant’s conduct caused the plaintiff’s mental distress; and   4. plaintiff's mental distress was extreme and severe.      To find that the defendant’s conduct was extreme and outrageous, you   must find the defendant’s conduct was so outrageous in character, and so   extreme in degree that it goes beyond the bounds of decency. You must also   find defendant’s conduct was atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized   community.      To find that the plaintiff’s emotional distress was extreme and severe, you   must find that the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was genuine and   so severe, and to such an extreme degree, that no reasonable person should be   expected to endure it.      Notes on Use      The trial court should give this instruction if the court has made the two threshold findings required   by the cases ruling on this type of claim. First, the court must decide whether the defendant’s conduct   may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery. Second, the court must   determine whether the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff is genuine and in such an extreme degree,   the law must intervene because the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable person should be   expected to endure it. Roberts v. Saylor, 230 Kan. 289, , 637 P.2d 1175 (1981).     In cases where bodily harm is claimed as a result of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the   court must give the jury a specific question of whether the evidence has proved the emotional distress   caused the claimed bodily injury.      2014      "      2014      Comment      Kansas courts first recognized this cause of action in Dawson v. Associates Financial Services Co.,   215 Kan. 814, 822, 529 P.2d 104 (1974), a case dealing with a debtor/creditor relationship. The wellspring   for the ruling was Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46(1).      The four elements listed in the instruction can be found in Roberts v. Saylor, 230 Kan. at 292. See   also Taiwo v. Vu, 249 Kan. 585, 592, 822 P.2d 1024 (1991). Those four elements were approved again in   Valadez v. Emmis Communications, 290 Kan. 472, 229 P.3d 389 (2010).      The Restatement points out that it is for the court to determine in the first instance whether the   defendant’s conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous that recovery is warranted.   Where reasonable minds differ it is for the jury, subject to the control of the court, to determine whether the   conduct has been extreme and outrageous. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46(1), comment h. Also,   whether the evidence proves severe emotional distress is a question of law. Whether it in fact occurred is a   jury question. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46(1), comments j and k. All reported cases after Saylor   v. Roberts have ruled that those two threshold findings must be made by the court. It is for this reason that   the Committee has placed the rule in the Notes on Use above.      When dealing with the concept of reckless conduct in this context, Wiehe v. Kukal, 225 Kan. 478,   592 P.2d 860 (1979), provides guidance. “. . . [R]ecklessness requires knowledge. The person who is   reckless must have prior knowledge; he must know or have reason to know of facts which create a high   degree of risk of harm to another, and then, indifferent to what harm may result, proceed to act.” 225 Kan.   at 484.     Fright, concern, embarrassment, worry, and nervousness do not constitute sufficient harm to warrant      the award of damages for a claim of outrage. Dana v. Heartland Management Co., Inc., 48 Kan.

One claiming injuries for emotional distress must show:      1. That the defendant’s conduct was extreme and   outrageous;      2. That the defendant’s conduct was directed at a third   person, other than the plaintiff;      3. That the plaintiff is a member of the immediate family of   that third person and was present; and      4. That the plaintiff sustained severe emotional distress /and   bodily harm] as a result of that conduct;      5. That the defendant, by (his) (her) conduct, intentionally   or recklessly caused severe emotional distress /and bodily harm]   to the plaintiff.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be used where the plaintiff claims that the outrageous conduct by the   defendant was directed at a member of the immediate family in the presence of the plaintiff and, as a result   of this conduct, plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress. It is not an essential element that plaintiff also   suffered bodily harm. This would be additional damage if bodily harm was sustained.      Comment   In Wiehe v. Kukal, 225 Kan. 478, 592 P.2d 860 (1979), the court adopted § 46, subparagraph 2 of   Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides:      “Where such conduct is directed at a third person, the actor is subject to liability if he intentionally   or recklessly causes severe emotional distress (a) to a member of such person’s immediate family who is   present at the time, whether or not such distress results in bodily harm ... “      2012                   "      <h4><a name='127.73' href='127.73'>127.73</a></h4><p>RECKLESSLY OR WITH INTENT—DEFINED      [Reckless conduct means a disregard or an indifference to the consequence   of that conduct under circumstances involving danger to life or safety of   others, although no harm was intended.

That the defendant made an (illegal) (improper)   (unauthorized) use of the process; and      2; That the defendant had knowledge of the (illegal)   (improper) (unauthorized) use of the process; and      3. That it was done for the purpose of (harassing)   (causing great inconvenience) (causing great hardship) to the   plaintiff; and      4. That the plaintiff sustained damage as a result.      Notes on Use      This instruction is to be used when the plaintiff is claiming that the defendant used the process of the   court, such as post-judgment executions, in an improper or illegal manner. The judgment may be valid but   the process in enforcing it may not be.      Comment      In Porter v. Stormont-Vail Hospital, 228 Kan. 641, 621 P.2d 411 (1980), the court, in affirming a   summary judgment, held the trial court had correctly stated the elements of abuse of process by quoting the   following from 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Abuse of Process § 4:     “It is generally recognized that the elements essential to sustain the action are: (1) that   the defendant made an illegal, improper, perverted use of the process [a use neither   warranted nor authorized by the process], and (2) that the defendant had an ulterior   motive or purpose in exercising such illegal, perverted, or improper use of process, and   (3) that damage resulted to the plaintiff from the irregularity. While the existence of an   ulterior motive may, perhaps, be inferred from the fact that process has been misused or   misapplied, the reverse is not true, for if the act of the prosecutor is in itself regular, the   motive, ulterior or otherwise, is immaterial.”     In the 1994 edition of Am. Jur. 2d, the statement of elements, substantially modified, appears at   §5.      2020                   <h4><a name='127.90' href='127.90'>127.90</a></h4><p>PRIVATE NUISANCE—INTENTIONAL      The essential elements required to sustain an action for an intentional   nuisance are:      1. The defendant acted with the intent of interfering with   the use and enjoyment of the land by those entitled to that use;      2. There was some interference with the use and enjoyment   of the land of the kind intended;      3. The interference that resulted, and the physical harm, if   any, from that interference, were substantial; and      4. The interference was of such a nature, duration, or   amount as to constitute unreasonable interference with the use   and enjoyment of the land.      As used in this instruction, a defendant’s interference with the use and   enjoyment of another’s land is intentional if the defendant (1) acts with   the purpose of causing such interference, or (2) knows such interference is   resulting or substantially certain to result from the defendant’s conduct.      Notes on Use      Authority for this instruction can be found in Williams v. Amoco Production Co., 241 Kan. 102,   734 P.2d 1113 (1987). See also Culwell v. Abbott Construction Co., 211 Kan. 359, 506 P.2d 1191 (1973);   Sandifer Motors, Inc. v. City of Roeland Park, 6 Kan.

This instruction should be used when there is a claim of unlawful interference with a person’s use or   enjoyment of his or her land and such interference is claimed to be the result of intentional conduct of the   defendant.     See PIK 4" , Nuisance Defined, and PIK 4" , Municipalities—Nuisance.      Comment      In Culwell v. Abbott Construction Co., 211 Kan. 359, 506 P.2d 1191 (1973), the court discussed the   differences between public and private nuisances. The Court also observed that “a nuisance may result   from conduct which is intentional or negligent or conduct which falls within the principle of strict liability   without fault.” 211 Kan. at 364.     Where a nuisance has its origin in negligence, as distinguished from an absolute nuisance, contributory   negligence is a defense. When tort liability is predicated on conduct less culpable than “intentional,” the   general rule is to compare fault and causation. Sandifer Motors, Inc. v. City of Roeland Park, 6 Kan. App.   2d 308, 628 P.2d 239, rev. denied 230 Kan. 819 (1981).     A nuisance action may be brought on the theory of strict liability or negligence; however, if the   statute of limitations has run on the strict liability and negligence theories, a plaintiff may find relief under      "      2012      "      2012      the theory of intentional nuisance. See Culwell v. Abbott Construction Co., 211 Kan. 359, 506 P.2d 1191   (1973) and United Proteins, Inc. v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 259 Kan. 725, 915 P.2d 80.     On the issue of intent, “to create an ‘intentional’ nuisance, it is not enough to intend to create a   condition causing harm; the defendant must either specifically intend to damage the plaintiff or act in such   a way as to make it ‘substantially certain’ that damage will follow.” Sandifer Motors, Inc. v. City of Roeland   Park, 6 Kan. App. 2d 308, 628 P.2d 239, rev. denied 230 Kan. 819 (1981). See also Culwell v. Abbott   Construction Co., 211 Kan. 359, 506 P.2d 1191 (1973); United Proteins, Inc. v.

The trial court did not err in failing to instruct on intentional nuisance where there was no evidence   defendant intended for natural gas to leak from its wells into plaintiff s irrigation water, nor was there any      evidence that defendant intended this condition to continue once discovered.

As applied to the manufacture, distribution, and sale of a product, it means the   failure of a manufacturer or seller to do something that a reasonably careful   manufacturer or seller engaged in the same business would do, or the doing of   something by a manufacturer or seller that a reasonably careful manufacturer   or seller engaged in the same business would not do. The degree of care must   be equal to the danger reasonably to be anticipated, measured by all the facts   and circumstances.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be used in every products liability case where liability is predicated on   negligence. Since the general duty of ordinary care includes the duties to design, inspect, test, and warn,   this instruction should constitute the first paragraph of any instruction pertaining specifically to a particular   duty.      Comment      The use of an earlier version of this instruction was approved in Timsah v. General Motors Corp.,   225 Kan. 305, 314, 591 P.2d 154 (1979). PIK 2d 13.01 [PIK 4" ] is cited with approval as a general   definition of negligence in Beck v. Kansas Adult Authority, 241 Kan. 13, 33, 735 P.2d 222 (1987).      The fact that a third party manufactures component parts does not affect the duty of the manufacturer   of the finished product. Further, a repairer is subject to the same duties as a manufacturer. Spencer v.   Madsen, 142 F.2d 820, (10th Cir. 1944). Under the Kansas Product Liability Act, K.S.A. 60-3301 et seq.,   the term “manufacturer” is defined to include the manufacturer of component parts.     The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may be invoked in an appropriate case where the liability of a   manufacturer or seller is predicated on negligence. Morrison v. Kansas City Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 175   Kan. 212, 263 P.2d 217 (1953); Nichols v. Nold, 174 Kan. 613, 258 P.2d 317 (1953) (holding that the   doctrine extends to multiple defendants).      In order to recover in a products liability case, the defective product must be the actual and proximate   cause of the injury. Wilcheck v. Doonan Truck & Equipment, Inc., 220 Kan. 230, 552 P.2d 938 (1976). A   manufacturer or seller of an article may be liable for property damage as well as for personal injury.   Spencer v. Madsen, 142 F.2d 820 (10" Cir. 1944).     Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan. App. 2d 200, 960 P.2d 255, rev. denied 265 Kan. 885 (1998).                 "      <h4><a name='128.02' href='128.02'>128.02</a></h4><p>DUTY AS TO PRODUCT DESIGN—MANUFACTURER AND SELLER      A (manufacturer) (seller) of a product has a duty to use ordinary care   in the design of the product so that it will be reasonably safe for the use for   which it is intended or which can reasonably be anticipated. In exercising this   duty, ordinary care must be exercised by the (manufacturer) (seller) to design   the product in such a way that the product is reasonably safe for the ordinary   consumer who possesses knowledge common to the community as to the   product’s characteristics. Failure to fulfill this duty constitutes negligence.      [You may consider evidence of an alternative design in your determination   of this issue, but it is not required to prove a design defect. Likewise, the fact   that a hazard is open and obvious or has been warned against are also factors   to be considered in analyzing whether a product is defective or dangerous.]      [If a product was at the time of manufacture in compliance with   (legislative regulatory standards) (administrative regulatory safety standards)   relating to design or performance, the product is not defective by reason of   design or performance, unless the plaintiff proves that a reasonably prudent   (manufacturer) (seller), could and would have taken additional precautions   to design the product so as to be reasonably safe for the ordinary consumer   who possesses knowledge common to the community as to the product’s   characteristics.]      [If the product was not at the time of manufacture in compliance with   (legislative regulatory standards) (administrative regulatory safety standards)   relating to design or performance, the product is defective unless the   (manufacturer) (seller) proves that its failure to comply was a reasonably   prudent course of conduct under the circumstances then existing. In this   regard, a course of conduct is reasonably prudent if the product is designed   to be reasonably safe for the ordinary consumer who possesses knowledge   common to the community as to the product’s characteristics.|      [If the product was at the time of manufacture in compliance with a   mandatory government contract specification relating to design, the product   is not defective for that reason.|      [If a product was not at the time of manufacture in compliance with a   mandatory government contract specification relating to design, the product   is defective for that reason.]      2008      "      2008      Notes on Use      This instruction should follow PIK 4" , Duty of Manufacturer and Seller, as a separate   paragraph.     PIK 4"  follows K.S.A. 60-3304. The additional bracketed paragraphs may be used where   required in a particular case.      Comment      A manufacturer has the duty to use reasonable care in the design of his products so that they will be   reasonably safe for their intended use, including any emergency uses which can be reasonably anticipated.   Garst v. General Motors Corporation, 207 Kan. 2, 484 P.2d 47 (1971). See also Stevens v. Allis-Chalmers   Mfg. Co., 151 Kan. 638, 100 P.2d 723 (1940).      The Garst opinion suggests several factors to be considered in determining whether or not the   manufacturer has exercised due care in the design of its products. These include:     1. Whether others in the field are using the same design or a safer design.   2. Whether a safer design not yet in use is known to be feasible.   3. Whether in the case of a new product there has been adequate testing.     The fact that the manufacturer has conformed to the practice of other manufacturers in the field is   not conclusive of ordinary care but only evidence of ordinary care. Compliance with a legislatively or   administratively enacted standard is, however, prima facie evidence of due care and that a conforming   product is not defective. Jones v. Hittle Service, Inc.,219 Kan. 627, 549 P.2d 1383 (1976). The presumption   created is rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence that a reasonably prudent product seller would   and could have taken additional precautions. Miller v. Lee Apparel Co., 19 Kan. App. 2d 1015, 881 P.2d   576 (1994); Pfeiffer v. Eagle Mfg. Co., 771 F. Supp. 1133 (D. Kan. 1991). There is no distinction between   design, performance, warnings and instructions as it relates to duty of a seller beyond administrative and   legislative standards. Alvarado v. J.C. Penney Co. Inc., 735 F. Supp. 371 (D. Kan. 1990).      In Prentice v. Acme Machine & Supply Co., 226 Kan. 406, 408, 601 P.2d 1093 (1979), the use of the   original PIK 13.02 [antecedent of PIK 4" ] was held improper in an action where a plaintiff s claim   was based solely on the theory of strict liability and not on the theory of negligence.      Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan. App. 2d 200, 960 P.2d 255, rev. denied 265 Kan. 885 (1998).      The Supreme Court in Delaney v. Deere and Co., 268 Kan. 769, 999 P.2d 930 (2000), held that   K.S.A. 60-3305(c) only applies to claims based upon an insufficient warning. It does not limit recovery for   a claim based upon a defective design or dangerous product. Delaney summarizes Kansas law regarding   design defects in a product:      “[W]hether a design defect in a product exists is determined using the consumer   expectations test. A plaintiff must show that the product is both in a defective condition   and dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary   consumer who purchased it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community   as to its characteristics. See Lester, 230 Kan. at 4, 641 P.2d 353 [Lester v. Magic   Chef, 230 Kan. 643, 641 P.2d 353 (1982)]. Betts, 236 Kan. at , 689 P.2d 795   [Betts v. General Motors Corp., 236 Kan. 108, 115, 689 P.2d 795 (1984)]. Evidence of   a reasonable alternative design may be introduced but is not required. Siruta, 232 Kan.   at , 659 P.2d 799 [Siruta v.

The fact that a hazard is open and obvious or has been                 "      warned against are factors to be considered in analyzing whether a product is defective   or unreasonably dangerous. The ultimate determination remains whether the product is   defective and dangerous beyond a reasonable consumer’s expectations.” Delaney, 268   Kan. at .      2008      "      2010      <h4><a name='128.03' href='128.03'>128.03</a></h4><p>DUTY TO INSPECT      A. Manufacturer      The manufacturer of a product has a duty to make a reasonable inspection   of the manufactured product for any defect. Failure to do so constitutes   negligence.      B. Seller      The seller of a product, although manufactured by another, has a duty to   make a reasonable inspection of the product for any defect. What constitutes   a reasonable inspection depends upon the nature of the product and all the   circumstances. Failure to make such an inspection constitutes negligence.   (Include here a description of the product and a more particular statement of   the duty as set forth in the comment.)      Notes on Use      A or B should be used as appropriate and should follow PIK 4" , Duty of Manufacturer and   Seller, as a separate paragraph.      Comment      Ordinary care requires the manufacturer and seller to make a reasonable inspection. Coleman Co.   v. Gray, 192 F.2d 265 (10" Cir. 1951) cert. denied 342 U.S. 943, 72 S. Ct. 554, 96 L. Ed. 701 (1952)   (manufacturer of pressing iron); Morrison v. Kansas City Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 175 Kan. 212, 263 P.2d   217 (1953) (bottler of beverage); Kitchener v. Williams, 171 Kan. 540, 236 P.2d 64 (1951) (seller of hot-   water heater).     A manufacturer’s duty to inspect extends to products manufactured by another which are component   parts of the product produced by the manufacturer. Rauch v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary   Corp., 252 Iowa 1, 104 N.W.2d 607 (1960) (manufacturer of a hot-water heater).      Under most circumstances the seller’s duty to inspect is considerably more limited than that of the   manufacturer. The seller’s duty of inspection depends on the type of product involved in a particular case.   In some cases the nature of the product being sold obviates the need for inspection. Thus the instruction   must be adapted to specific cases. Consider the following rules:     (1) In the sale in a sealed package or closed container of a product manufactured by   another, the seller has no duty to open the package or container and inspect the contents   unless the condition of the package or container is such as to indicate to the ordinary   person the possibility of a defect in or a danger from the contents.      (2) In the sale of a bottled product manufactured by another in a container, the seller   has a duty to make a reasonable inspection of the container itself for defects therein.     (3) In the sale of new and used automobiles, a dealer has a duty to make reasonable   tests for defects which would render the vehicle unsafe for use.                 "      A seller ordinarily is not obligated to inspect a product for latent defects. Nelson v. Healey, 151 Kan.   512, 99 P.2d 795 (1940). A seller may not, however, avoid liability by deliberately remaining uninformed   about a product. Cunningham v. Subaru of America, Inc., 684 F. Supp. 1567 (D. Kan. 1988).     Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan.

Manufacturer      The manufacturer of a product has a duty to make such tests for defects   as are reasonably necessary to assure safety of the product manufactured.   Failure to do so constitutes negligence.      B. Seller      The seller of a product, although manufactured by another, as a part   of (his) (her) duty of ordinary care, has a duty to make such tests for defects   as are reasonably necessary to assure safety of the products sold. Failure to   make such tests constitutes negligence.      Notes on Use      A or B should be used as appropriate and should follow PIK 4" , Duty of Manufacturer and   Seller, as a separate paragraph.      Comment      A manufacturer’s duty to test a product is recognized in Spencer v. Madsen, 142 F.2d 820 (10th Cir.   1944), and Lindquist v. Ayerst Laboratories, Inc., 227 Kan. 308, 319, 320, 607 P.2d 1339 (1980). This duty   extends to component parts manufactured by another.      While the law recognizes a testing obligation on the part of a seller in a few instances, the duty is   greatly limited in most cases. The seller’s duty of inspection depends on the type of product involved in a   particular case. The nature of the product involved may obviate the need for inspection. Thus the instruction   must be adapted to particular cases. Consider the following rules:      (1) In the sale of a product manufactured by another in a sealed package or closed   container, a seller has no duty to open the package or container and test the contents   thereof.      (2) A seller of food in other than sealed containers has a duty to test for impurities   and contamination that would be discoverable by any usual and ordinary test.     (3) In the sale of new and used automobiles, a dealer has a duty to make reasonable   tests for defects which would render the vehicle unsafe for use.      A seller has no duty to test for latent defects in a product, at least where he has obtained the product   from a reputable manufacturer and there is nothing to indicate to him any special need for testing. In   Cunningham v. Subaru of America, Inc., 684 F. Supp. 1567 (D. Kan. 1988), it is held that a seller cannot   avoid liability for selling defective products by deliberately engaging in an attempt to be uninformed about   the product’s attributes or characteristics.     Under Summers v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 243 Kan. 393, 757 P.2d 1255 (1988), this instruction   was properly denied when there were no allegations in the pleading or pretrial order which would support   a claim for liability for an inherent defect or the sale of a defective product.

The duty to warn includes a duty to provide a warning to dangers   inherent in use and the duty to provide adequate instructions for safe use.   Failure to so warn constitutes negligence.      [If the warning on the product was, at the time of manufacture, in   compliance with (legislative regulatory standards) (administrative regulatory   safety standards) relating to warnings or instructions, the product is not   defective by reason of the warning or instructions, unless the plaintiff proves   that a reasonably prudent (manufacturer) (seller) could and would have taken   additional precautions.|      [If the warning on the product was not, at the time of manufacture, in   compliance with (legislative regulatory standards) (administrative regulatory   safety standards) relating to warnings or instructions, the product is defective   unless the (manufacturer) (seller) proves that its failure to comply was a   reasonably prudent course of conduct under the circumstances. |      [If the warning on the product was, at the time of manufacture, in   compliance with a mandatory government contract specification relating to   warnings or instructions, then the product is not defective for that reason.|      [If the warning on the product was not, at the time of manufacture, in   compliance with a mandatory government contract specification relating to   warnings or instructions, the product is defective for that reason.]      [You are further instructed that any duty to warn against a danger or   hazard does not extend:      A.

To warnings, protecting against or instructing with   regard to dangers, hazards, or risks which are patent, open, or   obvious and which should have been realized by a reasonable   user or consumer of the product].      Notes on Use      This instruction should follow PIK 4" , Duty of Manufacturer and Seller, if the claim of   negligence is based upon a breach of a duty to warn.     Bracketed paragraphs are derived from K.S.A. 60-3304 and K.S.A. 60-3305 of the Kansas Product   Liability Act, and may be used in a particular case if appropriate under the evidence.      Comment      In Younger v. Dow Corning Corporation, 202 Kan. 674, 451 P.2d 177 (1969), the court held that the   manufacturer of a product who gave adequate warning of a potential hazard to an immediate vendee, an   industrial user, had no additional duty to warn the vendee’s employee. It was emphasized that the product,   a chemical compound used in an industrial process, was not a highly dangerous explosive or poisonous   product. The manufacturer had the right to anticipate that the employer would pass on the warning to its   employees.     An extensive discussion of duties of manufacturers and sellers is found in Jones v. Hittle Service, Inc.,   219 Kan. 627, 549 P.2d 1383 (1976). The court, in a case involving an LP gas explosion, stated that a seller   has a duty to warn concerning a dangerous product when he knows, or has reason to know, the product is,   or is likely to be, dangerous for the use for which it is supplied. On the other hand, the manufacturer of LP   gas fulfilled its duty to the ultimate consumer when it added a distinctive odor to the gas and ascertained the   distributor was adequately trained and familiar with the properties of the gas and safe methods of handling   it and was capable of passing this knowledge on to customers. The distributor had a duty to warn, but only   to the extent of dangers not known to the consumer.     The duty of a seller of a heating unit to give complete instructions as to its use was recognized in   House v. Wichita Gas Co., 137 Kan. 332, 20 P.2d 479 (1933). In Alexander v. Inland Steel Co., 263 F.2d 314   (8th Cir. 1958), the court said that the Kansas and Missouri law on the duty to warn was the same, and that   while a manufacturer was obligated to give warning if an article he manufactured was dangerous because   of its intended use, still recovery would be denied where a failure to warn was not the proximate cause of   the injury.     K.S.A. 60-3304 concerns situations where there is some legislative or administrative regulatory safety   standard relating to design, performance, warning, or instructions. See the comments to PIK 4 ,   Duty as to Product Design—Manufacturer and Seller, as to legislative and administrative standards.      K.S.A. 60-3305 limits the duty to warn to a “reasonable user or consumer” standard. See Miller v.   Lee Apparel Co., 19 Kan. App. 2d 1015, 881 P.2d 576 (1994).     There is no duty under K.S.A. 60-3305 for a manufacturer or seller of a product to warn members of   a profession against dangers generally known to that trade or profession. Mays v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 233   Kan. 38, 60, 661 P.2d 348 (1983); Kearney v. Kansas Public Service Co., 233 Kan. 492, 7, 665 P.2d   757 (1983).     The manufacturer of prescription drugs has a duty to warn the medical profession of dangerous side   effects of its products of which it knows, has reason to know, or should know, based upon its position as an   expert in the field and upon its research and publications in the field. Wooderson v. Ortho Pharmaceutical   Corp., 235 Kan. 387, 409, 681 P.2d 1038, cert. denied [Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Wooderson] 469      "      2010      "      2008      U.S. 965, 105 S. Ct. 365, 83 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1984) (holding failure to warn was not the cause in fact of   injury).     Under Summers v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 243 Kan. 393, 757 P.2d 1255 (1988), this instruction   was properly denied when there were no allegations in the pleading or pretrial order which would support   a claim for liability for an inherent defect or the sale of a defective product. In Prentice v. Acme Machine &   Supply Co., 226 Kan. 406, 408, 601 P.2d 1093 (1979), it was held to be error to give the original PIK 13.05   [antecedent of PIK 4" ] when the plaintiff s claim was based solely upon a theory of strict liability   and not on the theory of negligence.     In Nichols v. Central Merchandise, Inc., 16 Kan. App. 2d 65, 817 P.2d 1131 (1991), the court followed   the doctrine of “learned intermediary” expressed in Humes v. Clinton, 246 Kan. 590, 792 P.2d 1032 (1990),   that shields a manufacturer of prescription drugs from a claim of failure to warn of dangerous side effects.   The Nichols court applied this doctrine under the facts of the case to likewise shield a pharmacist.     For a discussion of the post-sale duty to warn see Patton v. Hutchinson Wil-Rich Mfg. Co., 253 Kan.   741, 861 P.2d 1299 (1993).     Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan. App. 2d 200, 960 P.2d 255, rev. denied 265 Kan. 885 (1998).     The Supreme Court in Delaney v. Deere and Co., 268 Kan. 769, 999 P.2d 930 (2000), held that   K.S.A. 60-3305(c) only applies to claims based upon an insufficient warning. It does not limit recovery for   a claim based upon a defective design or dangerous product. The Delaney court goes on to say that the duty   to warn generally encompasses two separate duties: the duty to provide a warning to dangers inherent in   use and the duty to provide adequate instructions for safe use.                              <h4><a name='128.06' href='128.06'>128.06</a></h4><p>DUTY OF BUYER OR CONSUMER      A (buyer) (consumer) has a duty to use ordinary care for (his) (her) own   safety and protection. (He) (She) must exercise ordinary care with reference to   those obvious defects and dangerous conditions about which (he) (she) knows   and understands or about which (he) (she) should know and understand. (He)   (She) also has a duty to use a product in accordance with adequate instructions   and warnings, and to use the product in a normal manner. Failure to fulfill   any of these duties constitutes negligence on the part of the (buyer) (consumer)   which you may consider in determining the comparative fault of the parties.      Notes on Use      The instruction is applicable only in those cases where liability is predicated on negligence and the   defendant contends that the buyer or consumer failed to observe defects or dangerous conditions, failed to   use the product according to the manufacturer’s direction and warning, or used the product in an abnormal   manner.      Comment      The rules of comparative fault apply when liability is predicated on negligence. See Glenn v. Fleming,   240 Kan. 724, 732 P.2d 750 (1987); Teepak, Inc. v. Learned, 237 Kan. 320, 699 P.2d 35 (1985); Negley   v. Massey Ferguson, Inc., 229 Kan. 465, 625 P.2d 472 (1981); Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439,   449, 450, 618 P.2d 788 (1980); Langhofer v.

G.A.C., Inc., 255 Kan. 264, 875 P.2d 949 (1994), states that dangers or hazards that are open   and obvious and which should be realized by a reasonable user do not impose a duty to warn. Note that   Kerns did not have a claim for a defective or dangerous product. The Supreme Court in Delaney v. Deere   and Co., 268 Kan. 769, 999 P.2d 930 (2000), held that K.S.A. 60-3305(c) only applies to claims based upon   an insufficient warning. It does not limit recovery for a claim based upon a defective design or dangerous   product.

A seller who breaches this warranty is liable to any person who may   reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who   is injured as a result.      Notes on Use      The first paragraph of the instruction is based on language found in K.S.A. 84-2-315.   The second paragraph of this instruction reflects the language contained in K.S.A. 84-2-318. This   section provides as follows:   “A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person   who may reasonably be expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods and who   is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the   operation of this section.”      Comment      This instruction is necessary only where there is evidence of plaintiff s reliance on the seller’s skill   or knowledge and a showing of a particular, intended purpose which differs from an ordinary purpose.   Lindquist v. Ayerst Laboratories Inc., 227 Kan. 308, 320, 607 P.2d 1339 (1980).     In Franklin v. Northwest Drilling Co., 215 Kan. 304, 524 P.2d 1194 (1974), the court held that there   is an implied warranty that equipment furnished for a water well is fit for that purpose when seller knows   the particular purpose for which the equipment is required and that the buyer relied on the seller’s skill   and judgment to select or furnish suitable equipment. The court further held that while the driller is bound   by an implied warranty that the work be performed in a workmanlike manner, in absence of an expressed   warranty, the driller is not bound by an implied warranty as to either quantity or quality of water. For   implied warranty of workmanlike performance see also Belger Cartage Serv., Inc. v. Holland Constr. Co.,   224 Kan. 320, , 582 P.2d 1111 (1978); and Global Tank Trailer Sales v. Textilana-Nease, Inc., 209   Kan. 314, 496 P.2d 1292 (1972).     The requirements of K.S.A. 84-2-316(2) relating to the exclusion or modification of an implied   warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is discussed in depth in Christopher & Son v. Kansas Paint   & Color Co., 215 Kan. 185, 523 P.2d 709, modified on rehearing 215 Kan. 510, 525 P.2d 626 (1974).   (Upon rehearing, the original opinion was modified to correct language in the opinion that an instruction   on implied warranty of merchantability was improper.) In Addis v. Bernardin, Inc., 226 Kan. 241,597 P.2d   250 (1979), a seller’s recommendation against the purchase of a product insisted upon by the buyer was                  "      held insufficient to avoid liability for breach of implied warranty for a particular purpose, where the seller   knew of, but failed to explain to buyer, the product’s incompatibility with the product’s intended use.     While implied warranties may be excluded under the UCC, a supplier in a consumer transaction may   not exclude, modify or otherwise attempt to limit an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose   under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act. See K.S.A. 50-639.      The UCC and the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, however, do not always control. Corral v. Rollins   Protective Services, Co., 240 Kan. 678, 732 P.2d 1260 (1987), should be considered. The court therein held   that while the UCC only applies to sales it does not preclude the application of common law warranties to   transactions which are not sales and clearly not controlled by the UCC. In Farrell v. General Motors Corp.,   249 Kan. 231, 240, 815 P.2d 538 (1991), the court held that while the consumer protection act prohibits   limitations of UCC warranties, a supplier may make promises or common-law warranties, other than those   implied by law as expressed in the UCC and may limit those promises. Note that K.S.A. 84-2a-101 et seq.,   affords consumer leases protection under the UCC and Consumer Protection Code.     Kansas has recognized an implied warranty of fitness for new houses, but not for used houses, where   the doctrine of caveat emptor still prevails. Heinsohn v. Motley, 13 Kan. App. 2d 66, 69, 70, 761 P.2d 796   (1988).     K.S.A. 84-2-318 provides that lack of privity is not a bar to recovery by a natural person who is   personally injured by a breach of warranty.

Polaris Leasing Corp., 234 Kan. 742, 675 P.2d 887 (1984), the   court held that implied warranties do not extend to a remote seller or manufacturer of an allegedly defective   product, which is not inherently dangerous, for only economic loss suffered by a buyer who is not in   contractual privity with the remote seller or manufacturer.

Ifconsequential damages are claimed, PIK 4* , Measure of Damages—Personal or Property—   Short Form, may be modified and added to the instruction.      Comment      For breach of warranty, liability is neither limited strictly to the purchase price paid nor to the   difference between the value of the goods at the time of the delivery and the value had they conformed to   the warranty.     Damages of the type that are the usual result of the breach of similar contracts may be recovered in   a proper case. Unusual damages may be recovered only where the special circumstances giving rise to the   unusual damages were reasonably within the contemplation of the contracting parties at the time of their   transaction. Steele v. J. I. Case Co., 197 Kan. 554, 419 P.2d 902 (1966); Naaf v. Griffitts, 201 Kan. 64, 439   P.2d 83 (1968).     In general, where an action is brought to recover damages resulting from a breach of warranty, the   measure of damages, in the absence of evidence showing a greater damage, is the difference between the   value of the property at the time of its delivery and the value it would have possessed had it conformed in   fact to the warranty. Lehigh, Inc. v. Stevens, 205 Kan. 103, 468 P.2d 177 (1970).     The giving of this instruction was expressly approved by the court in Brunner v. Jensen, 215 Kan.   416, 524 P.2d 1175 (1974), a case involving the sale of a breeding herd of cattle. This instruction was given   and approved in Dold v. Sherow, 220 Kan. 350, 552 P.2d 945 (1976).     The rule expressed by this instruction was held inapplicable by the court in Ricklefs v. Clemens, 216   Kan. 128, 531 P.2d 94 (1975). Plaintiff had purchased an automobile which neither he nor the seller knew   was stolen. The seller did warrant the title to be valid. Upon being apprised the car was stolen, plaintiff   brought an action for breach of warranty of title. He had, however, driven the car for nine months prior to   obtaining knowledge of the title defect. Plaintiff contended the usual measure of damages for breach of   warranty [PIK 4" ] should apply. The court, however, held damages should be based upon the value   of the automobile at the time the buyer’s possession was disturbed, not the value of the automobile at the   time it was delivered by the seller to the buyer.     K.S.A. 84-2-714(2) provides: “The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the   time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if   they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.”      2008       "      The instruction uses the word “delivery” instead of “acceptance” because the word is more understandable   to a jury and the time of delivery is ordinarily the time of acceptance. The term “acceptance” is a complex   term defined in K.S.A. 84-2-606.     Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan.

This rule applies although the (manufacturer) (seller) has exercised all   possible care in the preparation and sale of (his) (her) product and although   the (user) (consumer) has not bought the property from or entered into any   contractual relation with the seller.      A product is in a defective condition if it has (a defect) (defects) in (design)   (manufacturing) (instructions) (warnings), and such (a defect) (defects) existed   at the time the product left the (manufacturer’s) (seller’s) hands.      A defective condition is unreasonably dangerous if it is dangerous when   used in the way it is ordinarily used considering the product’s characteristics   and common usage, and is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be   contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchased it, with the ordinary   knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.      Comment   This instruction is based upon the theory of strict or enterprise liability which is embodied in   Restatement, 2d Torts, 402A, which provides as follows:      (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the   user or consumer or to his property, is subject to liability for physical harm thereby   caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if:      (a) The seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and      (b) It is expected to reach the user or consumer in the condition in which it   is sold.      (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although:      (a) The seller has exercised all possible care in preparation and sale of his   product, and      (b) The user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any   contractual relation with the seller.       2010      "      2020      Traditionally under Kansas decisions a person who has been injured by a defective product based his   action for recovery against a manufacturer or seller upon two theories. First, his claim can be predicated   in negligence, in which case in order to recover he must establish that the seller had a duty of due care,   breached that duty, and that the breach was the cause of plaintiff’s injury. A second theory of recovery is   to base liability on breach of a warranty. This theory is not based on any concept of fault, as is the case   with negligence, but is based on an express or implied agreement that the seller makes when he supplies a   product.     The early cases held that the party injured by a defective product could not recover on a theory of   breach of warranty unless there was privity of contract between the injured party and the manufacturer   or seller of the product. This requirement of privity was later eliminated in warranty cases by a series of   decisions holding that implied warranties are created not by any actual agreement between the parties but   by operation of law. Nichols v. Nold, 174 Kan. 613, 258 P.2d 317 (1953). Privity was also eliminated by   an amendment to the Uniform Commercial Code which extended the umbrella of protection for breach   of warranty beyond contractual parties to “any natural person who may reasonably be expected to use,   consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty.” (K.S.A.   84-2-318). With the removal of the requirement of privity the concept that a cause of action for an injury   resulting from a defective product should be based on the contract theory of warranty became logically   unacceptable to many judges and lawyers. The result was the development of the theory of strict liability in   tort to be applied in products liability cases.     The landmark case is Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., 59 Cal.2d 57, 27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377   P.2d 897 (1963). The rule of Greenman, which recognizes the theory of strict liability, has been adopted in   a number of jurisdictions. Liability under the rule of these cases is “strict” in the sense that it is unnecessary   to prove the defendant’s negligence and, since the theory of liability is in tort, the defendant cannot avail   himself of the usual contract or warranty defenses, such as lack of privity of contract, lack of notice to the   defendant of breach of warranty, lack of reliance on a warranty, or disclaimer of implied warranties, which   might be available in an action for breach of warranty. The strict liability doctrine is a vehicle of social   policy and looks toward protection of the public safety. The purpose of imposing strict liability is said to   be to ensure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by those who market such   products, rather than by the injured persons, who are powerless to protect themselves. See Restatement, 2d   Torts, § 402A, comment (c).     The value of strict tort liability is that the courts can reach the same result in a more direct and simple   manner than under the theory of breach of warranty. The simplicity of the new theory has made products   liability litigation less complicated, less time consuming, and less costly. It should be emphasized that the   theory of strict liability does not treat a manufacturer or seller as an insurer against any injuries caused by   the use of its product. In order to establish liability the injured party must prove:     (1) That the manufacturer or seller put on the market a product in a defective condition   unreasonably dangerous to the consumer; and     (2) That the defective product was the cause or contributed to cause the injury complained   of.     Restatement, 2d Torts, 402A, was originally adopted by the drafters to make it clear that the liability   of a manufacturer or seller for a defective product does not depend upon the intricacies of the law of sales.   In Kansas the decisions of our Supreme Court have emphasized several times that the obligation of a   manufacturer or seller to refrain from placing defective products on the market is based not upon contract   but is imposed by the law on the basis of public policy. Graham v. Bottenfield s, Inc., 176 Kan. 68, 269 P.2d   413 (1954); Chandler v. Anchor Serum Co., 198 Kan. 571, 426 P.2d 82 (1967); Huebert v. Federal Pacific   Electric Co., 208 Kan. 720, 494 P.2d 1210 (1972).     This rule has now been expressly adopted by the Supreme Court of Kansas in Brooks v. Dietz, 218   Kan. 698, 545 P.2d 1104 (1976). The case involved a suit against a manufacturer for damages arising from   an explosion of a home furnace.                  "      In Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 446, 618 P.2d 788 (1980), the court held that under the   doctrine of strict liability, the liability of a manufacturer and those in the chain of distribution extends to   those individuals to whom injury from a defective product may reasonably be foreseen. This is true only in   those situations where the product is being used for the purpose for which it was intended or for which it is   reasonably foreseeable it may be used.      The Kansas Product Liability Act establishes defenses for a “product seller” (K.S.A. 60-3306(a)) and   a “product seller that is a retail seller of used products” (K.S.A. 60-3306(b)). To take advantage of these   defenses, a product seller or retail seller of used products must establish facts specified in the appropriate   subsection of the statute.      The Committee has concluded that generally no additional instructions are required under these   provisions. The defenses, if asserted by a seller, would ordinarily be determined by the court on a motion   for summary judgment.     The original instruction defined the terms “defective condition” and “unreasonably dangerous” to   conform to the consumer expectation test adopted by the Supreme Court in Lester v. Magic Chef, Inc.,   230 Kan. 643, 641 P.2d 353 (1982). The consumer expectation test was also adhered to in Barnes v. Vega   Industries, Inc., 234 Kan. 1012, 1014, 676 P.2d 671 (1984), and Betts v. General Motors Corp., 236 Kan.   108, 115, 689 P.2d 795 (1984). PIK 2d 13.21, 13.22, and 13.23 [antecedent of PIK 4" , ,   and ] were approved in Siruta v. Hesston Corp., 232 Kan. 654, , 659 P.2d 799 (1983), also a   consumer expectation case.      The current instruction is modified to conform with Jenkins v. Amchem Products, Inc., 256 Kan.   602, 886 P.2d 869 (1994), a case involving a toxic herbicide and labeling. The plaintiff therein sought   to prevail upon a strict liability theory of design defect without proving any specific design defect. The   plaintiff sought only to prove that the product caused cancer and thus was an unreasonably dangerous   and defective product. The court disapproved of the plaintiff’s position. The court noted that the then PIK   13.21 [antecedent of PIK 4" ] not only defined “unreasonably dangerous” in terms of the consumer   expectations test, but also defined “defect” by way of the consumer expectations test. The court further   stated, “We question whether there is such a thing as a strict liability claim based on a ‘pure consumer   expectation test.’”(Emphasis added). 256 Kan. at 624.      The Jenkins court stated that imposing liability for a product without identifying what aspect of that   product is defective does not further these public policy considerations. The court, citing Lester v. Magic   Chef, Inc., 230 Kan. 643, 641 P.2d 353 (1982), stated:     “In Lester, this court acknowledged the requirement that a product be both defective and   unreasonably dangerous.” 256 Kan. at 630.   The court concluded that without proof of a specific claim of defect the plaintiff may not prevail.     Restatement (Second) of Torts, 402A, comment k excludes “unavoidably unsafe products” from the   coverage of strict liability for design defects. This doctrine has been recognized in Johnson v. American   Cyanamid Co., 239 Kan. 279, 718 P.2d 1318 (1986). Comment k is meant to shield a manufacturer from   liability when the product cannot be designed more safely, not when the product was mismanufactured or   was not accompanied by adequate warnings. Savina v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 247 Kan. 105, 115, 795 P.2d 915   (1990).     It should be noted that a strict liability theory is not applicable to a manufacturer’s post-sale duty to   warn. A negligence analysis is more appropriate. Patton v. Hutchinson Wil-Rich Mfg. Co., 253 Kan. 741,   861 P.2d 1299 (1993).     The Kansas Product Liability Act applies to actions based on strict liability in tort as well as negligence   involving property damage, personal physical injuries and attendant anguish or emotional harm. Fennesy   v. LBI Mgt., Inc., 18 Kan. App. 2d 61, 847 P.2d 1350 (1993).     In Elite Professionals, Inc. v. Carrier Corp., 16 Kan. App. 2d 625, 827 P.2d 1195 (1992), it was held   that disclaimer of warranty is not an available defense to a strict liability in tort claim.       2014      "      2014      Emphasizing the distinction between tort and contract, Kansas has adopted the “economic loss rule”   which states that a buyer of defective goods cannot sue in tort, either negligence or strict liability, when   the only injury consists of damage to the goods themselves. The action must be brought in contract. Koss   Construction v. Caterpillar, Inc., 25 Kan. App. 2d 200, 960 P.2d 255, rev. denied 265 Kan. 885 (1998).     Construing the common law of Kansas in tandem with the Kansas Products Liability Act, K.S.A.   60-3301 et seq., the Kansas Supreme Court concluded that sellers of used products are subject to strict   products liability in Kansas. Gaumer v. Rossville Truck & Tractor Co., 292 Kan. 749, Syl. J 3, 4, 257   P.3d 292 (2011).

Notes on Use      This instruction should be given following PIK 4" , Special Liability of Manufacturer or   Seller of Product to User or Consumer—Strict Liability. It sets forth the elements which must be proved by   plaintiff in order for him or her to recover in the specific products liability case being tried.      Comment      In Prentice v. Acme Machine & Supply Co., 226 Kan. 406, 601 P.2d 1093 (1979), the Supreme Court   held that PIK 2d 13.21 and 13.22 [antecedent of PIK 4  and ] should be given together for   maximum understanding by the jury of the law of strict liability. PIK 2d 13.22 and 13.23 [PIK 4"    and ] were cited with approval in Siruta v. Hesston Corp., 232 Kan. 654, , 659 P.2d 799   (1983).     A strict liability theory is not applicable to a manufacturer’s post-sale duty to warn. A negligence   analysis is more appropriate. Patton v. Hutchinson Wil-Rich Mfg. Co., 253 Kan. 741, 861 P.2d 1299 (1993).   Disclaimer of warranty is not a defense to a strict liability in tort claim. Elite Professionals, Inc. v. Carrier   Corp., 16 Kan.

The Kansas Product Liability Act applies to actions based on strict liability in tort as well as negligence   involving property damage, personal physical injuries and attendant anguish or emotional harm. Fennesy   v. LBI Mgt., Inc., 18 Kan. App. 2d 61, 847 P.2d 1350 (1993).     Miller v. Lee Apparel Co., 19 Kan. App. 2d 1015, 881 P.2d 576 (1994), states that regardless of the   theory of recovery, proof that the defendant caused the injury is a prerequisite to recovery.      2010      "       <h4><a name='128.19' href='128.19'>128.19</a></h4><p>PRODUCTS LIABILITY—STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT—   UNREASONABLE USE AS A DEFENSE—COMPARATIVE FAULT      It is a defense to an action against a (manufacturer) (seller) for injuries   resulting from the use of an unreasonably dangerous product, that the person   injured discovered the defect in the product, became aware of the danger, and   unreasonably continued to use the product.      Unreasonable use of the product may be considered in determining the   comparative fault of the parties.      Notes on Use      The rules of comparative fault apply when liability is predicated on negligence. This instruction   should be used where the defense of unreasonable use of a defective product is asserted by the manufacturer   or seller. For actions brought on the theory of breach of warranty, see PIK 4" , Express or Implied   Warranty—Unreasonable Use as a Defense—Comparative Fault.      Comment      Contributory negligence is not a defense in a products liability action brought under the theory   of strict liability. Restatement (Second) of Torts, 402A, comment n. If, however, the user or consumer   discovers the defect, is aware of the danger, and nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the   product and is injured by it he is barred from recovery. Brooks v. Dietz, 218 Kan. 698, 545 P.2d 1104 (1976).   The defense of unreasonable use of a product has also been recognized in warranty cases in Kansas. See   Huebert v. Federal Pacific Electric Co., 208 Kan. 720, 494 P.2d 1210 (1972); Bereman v. Burdolski, 204   Kan. 162, 460 P.2d 567 (1969). Neither is disclaimer of warranty a defense to strict liability in tort claim.   Elite Professionals, Inc. v. Carrier Corp., 16 Kan. App. 2d 625, 827 P.2d 1195 (1992).     Where the plaintiff’s action is based on a theory of negligence, negligence of the plaintiff in the use   of a product will not bar recovery but will diminish plaintiff’s recovery under the comparative negligence   statute, K.S.A. 60-258a. A question properly arises whether comparative fault should apply if the theory   of the plaintiffs case is strict liability in tort. If the language of the statute is read literally, it appears to   be applicable only in cases involving negligence and is not applicable where plaintiff’s theory is strict   liability.     However, it is difficult to understand why plaintiff's unreasonable use of the product should be   a complete bar when the plaintiff’s theory is strict liability, but will only diminish the recovery when   the defendant has been sued for negligence. Several courts have been faced with this problem and have   applied the concept of comparative fault in a strict liability case. Such a position was adopted by the   Wisconsin Supreme Court in Dippel v. Sciano, 37 Wis.2d 443, 155 N.W.2d 55 (1967). More recently the   Supreme Court of Alaska applied the doctrine of comparative fault where the plaintiff was proceeding   on the theory of strict liability. Butaud v. Suburban Marine & Sporting Goods, Inc., 555 P.2d 42 (Alaska   1976). The application of the comparative fault procedure to strict liability cases has been recommended   by a number of writers on the subject: Schwartz, Comparative Negligence in Kansas, Legal Issues and   Probable Answers, 13 Washburn L J 397, 411 (Summer 1974); Kelly, Comparative Negligence—Kansas,   43 JBK 151, 198 (Fall 1974); Vasos, Comparative Negligence Update—A Discussion of Selected Issues, 44      2008       "      J.B.A.K. 13, 42 (Spring 1975); Products Liability Position Paper, Defense Research Institute, Inc., 1976,   Vol. 9 at page 16.     In Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788 (1980), the Supreme Court held that the   doctrine of comparative fault is applicable to both strict liability claims and to claims based on implied   warranty in products liability cases.       2008      "      2010      <h4><a name='128.20' href='128.20'>128.20</a></h4><p>PRODUCTS LIABILITY—RIGHT TO RECOVER LIMITED   TO USEFUL SAFE LIFE OF PRODUCT      A (manufacturer) (seller) is not subject to liability in a products liability   claim if the (manufacturer) (seller) proves that the harm was caused after the   product’s useful safe life had expired. “Useful safe life” begins at the time of   delivery of the product and extends for the time during which the product   would normally be likely to perform or be stored in a safe manner. “Time   of delivery” means the time of delivery of the product to its first (purchaser)   (lessee) who (buys) (leases) it to use it.      It is for you to determine whether the useful safe life of the product   had expired at the time the injury occurred in this case. In making such a   determination, you may consider the following factors:      1. The amount of wear and tear to which the product has been subject;      2. the effect of deterioration from natural causes, from climate, and   from other conditions under which the product was used or stored;      3. the normal practices of the user, similar users and the product seller   with respect to the circumstances, frequency, and purposes of the product’s   use, and with respect to repairs, renewals, and replacements;      4. any representations, instructions, or warnings made by the product   seller concerning proper maintenance, storage, and use of the product or the   expected useful safe life of the product; and      5. any modification or alteration of the product by a user or third party.   If you find that the defendant has proved to your satisfaction that the injury   suffered by the plaintiff in this case was caused at a time after the useful safe   life of the product had expired, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover   from the defendant.      Notes on Use      This instruction has been included to comply with the “useful safe life” concept contained in the   Kansas Product Liability Act (K.S.A. 60-3303).     It should be noted under K.S.A. 60-3303(a)(2), a product seller may be subject to liability for harm   caused by a product used beyond its useful safe life to the extent that the product seller has expressly   warranted the product for a longer period. The existence of such an express warranty would be a question   of law for the trial court to determine. If such an express warranty exists, then this instruction would not be   required.                  "      Comment      Under the Kansas Product Liability Act (K.S.A. 60-3303(b)(2)), if a claim involving harm occurs   more than ten years after the time of delivery, then a presumption arises that the harm resulted after the useful   safe life of the product had expired. In this regard, see PIK 4" , Products Liability—Presumption of   Expiration of Useful Safe Life of Product After Use for 10 Years.       2008      "      2020      <h4><a name='128.21' href='128.21'>128.21</a></h4><p>PRODUCTS LIABILITY—PRESUMPTION OF EXPIRATION OF   USEFUL SAFE LIFE OF PRODUCT AFTER USE FOR 10 YEARS      In a products liability claim, when the injury to the plaintiff occurred   more than ten years after the time of delivery of the product, the law presumes   that the harm was caused after the useful safe life of the product had expired.   Unless this presumption has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence   to the contrary, you must find that the harm suffered by plaintiff in this case   was caused after the useful safe life of the product had expired and plaintiff   may not recover.      [You are further instructed that the ten-year-period presumption does   not apply, if the (manufacturer) (seller) intentionally misrepresented facts   about its product or fraudulently concealed information about it, and that   conduct was a substantial cause of the plaintiff’s harm.]      [You are further instructed that the ten-year-period presumption does   not apply if the harm to plaintiff was caused by prolonged exposure to a   defective product, or if the injury-causing aspect of the product that existed   at the time of delivery was not discoverable by a reasonably prudent person   until more than ten years after the time of delivery, or if the harm caused   within ten years after the time of delivery, did not manifest itself until after   that time.]      [You are further instructed that the ten-year-period presumption does not   apply to the time to discover a disease which is latent and caused by exposure   to a harmful material.|      Notes on Use      This instruction covers the ten-year presumption created by the Kansas Product Liability Act (K.S.A.   60-3303). It should be given, if appropriate, only in cases where the plaintiff suffered injury more than ten   years after the time of delivery of the product.      Comment      The Kansas Product Liability Act provides a two-year statute of limitations for a product liability   claim, unless exceptions stated or referenced within the act apply. Such exceptions are termed as “periods   of repose.” Fennesy v. LBI Mgt., Inc., 18 Kan. App. 2d 61, 847 P.2d 1350 (1993). See also Harding v. K.C.

Each party has the burden of proving its claims of fault against any other   party.

Supp. 707 (D. Kan. 1977).   Claims predicated upon breach of implied warranty as well as strict liability are subject to comparative   fault treatment. Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, 228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788 (1980). This instruction is designed   to show the general relationship of liability of a manufacturer or seller predicated upon negligence (PIK 4"   ), implied warranty (PIK 4"  and ), and strict liability (PIK 4% ).     Negligence, breach of implied warranty, and strict liability are alternative theories of liability. Jones   v. Hittle Service, Inc., 219 Kan. 627, 549 P.2d 1383 (1976); Brooks v.

Regardless of whether the plaintiff is claiming damages under negligence, breach of warranty, or   strict liability the plaintiff must prove the product was defective; it was defective at the time it left the   defendant’s possession or control; and, that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of such defect.

If you so find, then the court may   appoint a guardian of (his) (her) person and a conservator to manage (his)   (her) affairs.      A person is presumed to be competent, but that presumption may be   overcome by evidence establishing that the person is an adult with an   impairment in need of a guardian or conservator, or both.      The term “adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or a   conservator, or both” means a person whose ability to receive and evaluate   relevant information, or to effectively communicate decisions, or both, even   with the use of assistive technologies or other supports, is impaired such   that the person lacks the capacity to manage such person’s estate, or to meet   essential needs for physical health, safety, or welfare, and who is in need of a   guardian or a conservator, or both.      The term “in need of a guardian” means a person who because of both   an impairment and the lack of appropriate alternatives for meeting essential   needs, requires the appointment of a guardian.      The term “in need of a conservator” means a person who because of both   an impairment and the lack of appropriate alternatives for managing such   person’s estate, requires the appointment of a conservator.      The phrase “meet essential needs for physical health, safety, or welfare”   means making those determinations and taking those actions which are   reasonably necessary in order for a person to obtain or be provided with   shelter, sustenance, personal hygiene or health care, and without which serious   illness or injury is likely to occur.

That the respondent suffers from a (mental abnormality)   (personality disorder) which makes the respondent likely to   engage in repeat acts of sexual violence; and      3.

"      Comment      Although the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act (KSVPA) is considered a civil proceeding, it   contains many similarities with a criminal prosecution. The KSVPA involves the attorney general as the   state’s attorney, the respondent has a right of jury trial, the verdict must be unanimous, and the evidentiary   burden is beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the respondent is entitled to a probable cause hearing,   is entitled to appointed counsel, and risks confinement in the custody of the Secretary of Social and   Rehabilitation Services. In re Care & Treatment of Foster, 280 Kan. 845, , 127 P.3d 277 (2006).     The Foster court found reversible error when the state’s attorney, in the opening statement, advised   the jury that a multidisciplinary team of professionals, a team of prosecutors, and the judge had previously   reviewed the case and determined that it should proceed to trial. The court held that telling the jury this   information was attorney misconduct, extremely prejudicial, and denied the respondent his right to fair   trial. Id., 280 Kan. at . In accord see In re Care & Treatment of Ward, 35 Kan. App. 2d 356, 131   P.3d 540 (2006) (finding reversible error when the state’s attorney in a KSVPA commitment proceeding   appealed to juror’s personal fears for the safety of their own children and the community’s children).      Foster further held that, absent a stipulation by the parties, direct or indirect evidence concerning   any polygraph examination performed upon the respondent, and any opinions based upon those results, are   inadmissible. 280 Kan. at .      In the case of In re Care & Treatment of Searcy, 274 Kan. 130, 49 P.3d 1 (2002), the Kansas Supreme   Court reversed the respondent’s commitment as a sexually violent predator by finding that the respondent   was not brought to trial within 60 days after the K.S.A. 59-29a05 probable cause determination. The   decision held that the 60-day time limit was jurisdictional, mandatory, and analogous to the statutory right   to speedy trial in criminal cases. In 2003, the legislature amended the Sexually Violent Predator Act to   provide that none of the time limits in the Act are intended now or ever were intended to be mandatory or   to otherwise affect the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction over commitment proceedings.     The 2003 amendments to the Act were considered by the Kansas Court of Appeals in Jn re Care   & Treatment of Hunt, 32 Kan. App. 2d 344, 82 P.3d 861 (2004), rev. denied 278 Kan. 844 (2004), which   found no due process violation in the retroactive application of the amendments. The court further held that   because the 60 day time limit of K.S.A. 59-29a06 is now directory and not mandatory, the failure to bring   a respondent to trial within 60 days of the determination of probable cause does not divest the district court   of subject matter jurisdiction in any properly commenced proceedings.     In In re Care & Treatment of Hay, 263 Kan. 822, 953 P.2d 666 (1998), the Kansas Supreme Court   extensively examined the Sexually Violent Predator Act. The court held that the Act was not overly broad,   did not violate due process or equal protection, and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.   Additional claims that the Act violated the privilege against self-incrimination and the prohibition against   double jeopardy or ex post facto laws were similarly rejected.     The Kansas Supreme Court in Jn re Care & Treatment of Miller, 289 Kan. 218, 210 P.3d 625 (2009)   stated that neither State v. Gunby, 282 Kan. 39, 144 P.3d 647 (2006), nor K.S.A. 60-455 govern admission of   prior acts evidence in sexually violent predator commitment proceedings. See also Jn re Care & Treatment   of Colt, 289 Kan. 234, 211 P.3d 797 (2009).      The use of the word “likely” in the KSVPA’s definition of “sexually violent predator” does not   establish a lesser burden of proof in civil commitment cases than is required under the Due Process Clause   of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

[Sexually motivated” means that one of the purposes for which the   respondent committed the crime was the respondent’s sexual gratification.]      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 59-29a02. The bracketed definition should only be given when that is an   allegation for the jury to decide.     The term “personality disorder” is not defined by the statute. For a psychiatric definition, see   American Psychiatric Ass’n., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, 4" Ed.,   1994). The constellation of various conditions recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as   constituting personality disorders make impossible a pattern definition. Notwithstanding, the Committee   does recommend that the trial judge fashion an appropriate definitional instruction based upon the specific   diagnosis stated in the American Psychiatric Association manual.

Notes on Use      This introductory instruction should be adapted for use in every condemnation case.      Comment      An appeal may be taken from the appraisers’ award by the condemnor, landowner, or other interest-   holder. When an appeal is taken the effect is to bring to the district court the question of the sufficiency of   the award. The trial of that issue is heard de novo. K.S.A. 26-508.      Ifa dispute arises concerning the allocation of the total award made by a jury, K.S.A. 26-517 provides   that the district court shall thereafter determine the final distribution among competing interests.     A limited participation by a lessee in jury trial concerning the value of the whole of the property may   occur in appropriate circumstances. City of Manhattan v. Kent, 228 Kan. 513, 618 P.2d 1180 (1980).     In an inverse condemnation proceeding, whether there has been a compensable taking of property is   a question of law for the trial judge. Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21 (1996). A ruling   on this issue should be made in advance of trial.     Regulatory takings that may be subject to inverse condemnation proceedings include physical, title,   and economic takings. Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21 (1996).     The measure of damages for a partial taking in an inverse condemnation proceeding is the difference   between the value of the entire property immediately before the taking and the value of that portion of   the property remaining immediately after the taking. Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21   (1996).     In Woods v. Unified Gov’t of Wyandotte County/KCK, 294 Kan. 292, 275 P.3d 46 (2012), the   appellant sought to have the 30-day appeal time enlarged. In denying the request, the Supreme Court   affirmed a prior ruling that an eminent domain proceeding is a special statutory proceeding that is not a   civil action covered by the Kansas Code of Civil Procedure. The court noted that the result of the case in   In re Condemnation of Land v. Stranger Valley Land Co., 280 Kan. 576, 578, 123 P.3d 731 (2005), a case   involving a prior version of K.S.A. 26-508 and holding that a district court did not have jurisdiction to   enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal in an eminent domain proceeding, was still valid.      2012      "      2008      <h4><a name='131.02' href='131.02'>131.02</a></h4><p>BURDEN OF PROOF      The Committee recommends that there be no instruction on burden of   proof.      Comment      The general doctrine of burden of proof is not applicable to a condemnation proceeding and it is   better that such instruction not be given. City of Wichita v. Jennings, 199 Kan. 621, Syl. J 6, 433 P.2d 351   (1967).     In City of Wichita v. May’s Company, Inc., 212 Kan. 153, 510 P.2d 184 (1973), the court affirmed   the elimination of burden of proof doctrine, stating, “[i]n a trial of a condemnation appeal, neither party   is charged with the burden of proof, but they share an equal duty and responsibility to supply competent   evidence upon which a verdict can be based.”                            "      <h4><a name='131.03' href='131.03'>131.03</a></h4><p>MEASURE OF COMPENSATION—TAKING OF ENTIRE TRACT      The measure of compensation you are to award to the owner is the fair   market value of the (property) (interest in property) at the time of the taking.   The date of the taking was ;      Your award of compensation must fall within the range of testimony as   to the fair market value of the (property) (interest in property) at the time of the   taking.      In determining the amount of compensation you award to the owner, you   should consider all of the circumstances shown by the evidence that reasonably   bear on the issue of fair market value including the following factors:      [List the applicable statutory factors from K.S.A. 26-513(d)].      The above factors are not to be considered as separate items of damages,   but are to be considered only as they affect the fair market value of the      property.      Notes on Use      The date of taking is the date the appraisers’ award is paid into court under K.S.A. 26-507(a).     The third paragraph of this instruction may recite those statutory factors in K.S.A. 26-513(d) which   are shown by the evidence, or such factors as the court may decide are more descriptive and tailored to the   evidence presented.     Instructing the jury that its finding “must fall within the range of testimony as to the fair market   value” implements Mettee v. Kemp, 236 Kan. 781, 696 P.2d 947 (1985), and works well when all opinion   evidence of value is based upon comparable sales and uses the unit rule. Because of the 1999 amendment   to K.S.A. 26-513(e), however, there may be cases in which use of this language may be inappropriate. The   amendment permits fair market value to be determined “by the use of comparable sales, cost or capitalization   of income appraisal methods or any combination of such methods.” Creason v. Unified Gov t of Wyandotte   County, 272 Kan. 482, 33 P.3d 850 (2001), held admissible expert testimony using the capitalization of   income method to determine the value of a gas well even though the expert was not qualified to testify   about land values generally and could not give an opinion about the unit fair market value of the property.   When the testimony of such an expert is admitted, it may provide a basis for a jury award outside the range   of testimony given by appraisers who relied upon some other method of valuation, such as comparable   sales alone, to derive a value.      Comment      Improvements upon the land, although not to be valued separately, are to be considered in ascertaining   market value. Hoy v. Kansas Turnpike Authority, 184 Kan. 70, 334 P.2d 315 (1959). Minerals may not be   valued separately. Reiter v. State Highway Commission, 177 Kan. 683, 281 P.2d 1080 (1955).     The unit rule in Hoy is applicable whenever the market data approach of appraisal is employed. The   depreciated replacement cost method or the capitalization of income method do not require the application   of the unit rule. Ellis v. City of Kansas City, 225 Kan. 168, 589 P.2d 552 (1979).      2008      "       The 1999 amendment to K.S.A. 26-513(e) provides that fair market value “shall be determined by   use of the comparable sales, cost or capitalization of income appraisal methods or any combination of such   methods.” The comparable sales method no longer is the preferred method of valuing property. Creason   v. Unified Gov t of Wyandotte County, 272 Kan. 482, 33 P.3d 850 (2001); City of Wichita v. Eisenring, 269   Kan. 767, 7 P.3d 1248 (2000).     Although expert testimony may be admitted which relates solely to the future income potential   of the property, an aspect of the “unit rule” nevertheless remains effective to provide that an award of   compensation must reflect the value of the property as a whole. Creason v. Unified Govt of Wyandotte   County, 272 Kan. 482, Syl. 1 5, 33 P.3d 850 (2001). There is an important distinction between the measure   of value and the evidence admissible to prove it. The award of just compensation cannot assign separate   values to component parts of the property, such as by giving one value to the land, another value to the   water rights, and another to the mineral rights. However, to demonstrate how the value of the property as a   whole is enhanced by a natural asset, evidence can be introduced of its separate value. Zd., Syl. $ 4.     In City of Olathe v. Stott, 253 Kan. 687, 861 P.2d 1287 (1993), the court held that the jury properly   followed the jury instruction, which was based on PIK 2d 11.03 [PIK 4" ], when it reduced the value   of the property by 10% due to contamination.     The jury’s findings as to the “before” and “after” value of the property taken must fall within the   range of the opinion testimony. This includes the opinion testimony of the landowner as to value. Mettee v.   Kemp, 236 Kan. 781, 696 P.2d 947 (1985). Additur or remittitur is not an appropriate remedy in an eminent   domain proceeding where the jury’s finding of “after” value is outside the range of the opinion testimony;   the trial court must grant a motion for new trial. In re Condemnation of Land for State Highway Purposes,   269 Kan. 128, 3 P.3d 1268 (2000).     The court has an obligation to initially determine the relevancy of a prior sale being urged as   a comparable sale. The court should consider such factors as: whether the prior sale was a bona fide   and voluntary arm’s length transaction; whether the prior sale was too remote in time; and whether the   conditions of the previously sold property and surrounding area are sufficiently similar to the condemned   land. Mooney v. City of Overland Park, 283 Kan. 617, 153 P.3d 1252 (2007).     Considerable discretion is vested in the trial court in an eminent domain proceeding in admitting or   rejecting evidence of value, and the latitude accorded to the parties in bringing out collateral and cumulative   facts to support value estimates is left largely to the discretion of the trial court. Butler County Rural Water   Dist. No. 8 v. Yates, 275 Kan. 291, 64 P.3d 357 (2003).      The only issue on an appeal from a condemnation award is the fair market value of the property   taken, and the court’s authority does not extend beyond that which is conferred by statute. As such, the   court has no jurisdiction to address constitutional issues or attorney fees claimed. Miller v. Bartle, 283   Kan. 108, 150 P.3d 1282 (2007).      A property owner’s opinion as to the fair market value of the owner’s land is relevant to the   determination of the issue of fair market value. However, a property owner may not testify using an   appraisal method for which the property owner has not been established as an expert. Manhattan Ice   and Cold Storage, Inc. v. City of Manhattan, 294 Kan. 60, 274 P.3d 609 (2012); and Jn re Acquisition of   Property by Eminent Domain, 299 Kan. 37, 320 P.3d 955 (2014).      2020                 <h4><a name='131.04' href='131.04'>131.04</a></h4><p>MEASURE OF COMPENSATION—PARTIAL TAKING      Only part of the owner’s (property) (interest in property) was taken in this   proceeding. The property taken was (description of property taken), leaving the   owner with (description of property remaining). The measure of compensation   you should award under these circumstances is the difference between the   fair market value of the entire property immediately before the taking and   the value of the property remaining with the owner immediately after the   taking. The date of taking was      To arrive at a proper award in this proceeding, your first obligation is   to determine the fair market value of the entire property immediately before   the taking.

Next, determine the value of the property remaining with the owner   immediately after the taking. Your finding must fall within the range of   testimony about the value immediately after the taking.      Finally, subtract your finding of the value of the property remaining   immediately after the taking from your finding of the fair market value of the   entire property immediately before the taking. The difference is the amount   of your award.      In determining the amount of compensation you award to the property   owner, you must consider all of the circumstances shown by the evidence that   reasonably bear on the issue of value of the property, including the following   factors:      [List the applicable statutory factors from K.S.A. 26-513(d)].      The above factors are not to be considered by you as separate items   of damage, but are to be considered only as they affect the value of the      property.      Notes on Use      The fifth paragraph of this instruction should recite those statutory factors in K.S.A. 26-513(d) which   are shown by the evidence or such factors as the court and counsel may decide would be more descriptive   and tailored to the evidence presented. An additional recognized factor not included in the statute’s non-   exclusive list, but appropriate in most cases, is any other evidence which a buyer or seller would consider   in determining a purchase price for the property. See Kansas City Power and Light v. Strong, 302 Kan. 712,   726, 356 P.3d 1064 (2015).     Instructing the jury that its finding “must fall within the range of testimony as to the fair market   value” implements Mettee v. Kemp, 236 Kan. 781, 696 P.2d 947 (1985), and works well when all opinion   evidence of value is based upon comparable sales and uses the unit rule.

A landowner is not entitled to have the value of the land enhanced merely by the result of the public   improvement. The property owner should neither be penalized for nor benefited by any deflationary or   inflationary effect of the nature of the improvement itself. Board of Sedgwick County Comm'rs v. Kiser   Living Trust, 250 Kan. 84, Syl. 1 2, 825 P.2d 130 (1992).     Damages based on fears of danger inherent in transmission lines held to be too speculative,   conjectural, or remote. Yagel v.

Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21   (1996).     There is a legal distinction between “right of access” and “regulation of traffic flow.” Loss of the   former supports compensation; the latter is a police power and so long as reasonable, precludes compensation.   Eberth v. Carlson, 266 Kan. 726, 971 P.2d 1182 (1999); City of Wichita v. McDonald 5 Corp., 266 Kan.   708, 971 P.2d 1189 (1999). In Eberth, the Supreme Court noted its economic taking discussion in Garrett   v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21 (1996), is limited to its specific facts. 266 Kan. at . In   Miller v. Preisser, 295 Kan. 356, 284 P.3d 290 (2012), the court discusses the distinction between “right of   access” and “regulation of traffic flow.” The court, however, makes it clear that an unreasonable exercise   of police power in exercising the right to regulate traffic flow is not an element of compensation in eminent   domain matters.     In City of Wichita v. McDonald, supra, confronted with the landowner’s complaints of dust, rodents   and construction noise, it was held absent a showing of damages special to the property affected, and not   damages suffered by the general public, there can be no recovery. 266 Kan. at 720.     City of Wichita v. McDonald s also held “the term ‘view’ in K.S.A. 26-513(d)(5) does not mean view   from the highway or the ‘right to be seen’; it means view from the property.” 266 Kan. 708, Syl. 1 6.

Fair market value shall be determined by use of (1) the comparable sales   method, which values the property based upon the recent sales of comparable   property; (2) the depreciated replacement cost method, which values the   property based upon the reproduction cost of the property less depreciation;   (3) the capitalization of income method, which values the property based upon   the capitalization of net income from the property; or (4) any combination of   these methods.      In determining fair market value, you should consider all of the possible   uses to which the property could have been put, including the best and most   advantageous use to which the property was reasonably adaptable, but your   considerations must not be speculative, conjectural, or remote. The uses which   may be considered must have been so reasonably probable as to have had an   effect on the fair market value of the property at the time of the taking.      Notes on Use      K.S.A. 26-513 calls for “just compensation” and provides that the measure of compensation is the   “fair market value” of the property. See K.S.A. 26-513(e) for the definition of “fair market value.”     The paragraph specifying the appraisal methods that are to be used to determine value should be   given when evidence of value based upon more than one method is admitted but any method that was not   the basis of evidence admitted at trial should be omitted.      Comment      The 1999 amendment to K.S.A. 26-513(e) specified the appraisal methods to be used in valuing real   estate and placed the three generally recognized methods on equal footing. The comparable sales method   no longer is the preferred method of valuation. Creason v. Unified Gov t of Wyandotte County, 272 Kan.   482, 33 P.3d 850 (2001); City of Wichita v. Eisenring, 269 Kan. 767, 7 P.3d 1248 (2000).

In Manhattan Ice and Cold Storage, Inc. v. City of Manhattan, 294 Kan. 60, 274 P.3d 609 (2012), the   Supreme Court approved of the PIK Committee’s comment in PIK 4"  and the notes on use in PIK   4"  and , and specifically stated that  and  were outdated methods of determining   value. The court stated that all generally recognized methods of determining fair market value, as set forth   in K.S.A. 26-513, are covered by PIK 4" .     In Miller v. Preisser, 295 Kan. 356, 284 P.3d 290 (2012), the Supreme Court found that the doctrine   of assemblage may be used as a factor in determining appropriate damages. This doctrine applies when   the highest and best use of separate parcels involves their integrated use with other lands. The integrated   use must be present or reasonably probable in the near future. If the integrated use is present or reasonably   probable, the property owner may introduce evidence that the fair market value of the owner’s real estate   is enhanced by its assemblage with another parcel or parcels. The court stated, however, that when this   doctrine applies, the trial court should specifically instruct the jury that compensation must be limited to   the loss in fair market value of the land in issue and that any diminution in the value of the other land in   assemblage may not be considered.       2014      "      2012      <h4><a name='131.06' href='131.06'>131.06</a></h4><p>PROBABILITY OF REZONING      If you find that the best use to which the land could have been put at   the time of the taking was a use other than that for which it was zoned at the   time, and that there was a reasonable probability of its being later rezoned to   permit such use, then you may consider such use in determining the market   values.      Notes on Use      This instruction, when applicable, shouldbe given following PIK 4" , Market Value—Definition.   The situation requiring this instruction will usually arise where the property is in an area that is susceptible   of being zoned for a use other than that for which it is being used at the time of condemnation.

Determining the uses to which the property was reasonably adaptable includes consideration of a   reasonable probability of zoning changes. Board of Johnson County Comm'rs v. Smith, 280 Kan. 588, 123   P.3d 1271 (2005).     The Supreme Court approved the wording in this instruction in Kansas City Mall Assocs. v. Unified   Gov't of Wyandotte County/KCK, 294 Kan. 1, 272 P.3d 600 (2012) as a correct statement of the law   regarding the possibility of rezoning and the property’s highest and best use. The court further cautioned   that zoning was not dispositive of the issue of fair market value.

PIK 2d 11.13 included a definition of limited access   facility patterned after K.S.A. 68-1901. The Committee does not believe that definition would normally   mean anything to a jury or help them in determining market value.      Comment      Where a new controlled access highway is established by condemnation through property where   no highway previously existed, there is no taking of a right of access because no such right of access   in fact existed. Moore v. State Highway Commission, 191 Kan. 624, 383 P.2d 549 (1963). But compare   Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d 21 (1996), where it was held a landowner was entitled to   compensation for the impairment of access where the rerouting or circuity of travel was unreasonable.      Whether the State Highway Commission has exceeded the police power in restricting access rights   to a highway is a matter for the determination of the trial court as a matter of law and this determination   should be made before the case is submitted to the jury to ascertain damages. Brock v. State Highway   Commission, 195 Kan. 361, 404 P.2d 934 (1965).     An owner of land adjoining a road or highway enjoys a right of access which entitles the owner to   go and return from his own land to the road or highway without unreasonable interference. The right of an   abutting owner cannot be taken or materially interfered with without just compensation. Pringle v. City of   Wichita, 22 Kan. App. 2d 297, Syl. § 2, 917 P.2d 1351 (1996).     There is a legal distinction between “right of access” and “regulation of traffic flow.” Loss of the   former supports compensation; the latter is a police power and so long as reasonable, precludes compensation.   Eberth v. Carlson, 266 Kan. 726, 971 P.2d 1182 (1999); City of Wichita v. McDonald’s Corp., 266 Kan.   708, 971 P.2d 1189 (1999). See also Korytkowski v.

In Eberth, the   Supreme Court noted its economic taking discussion in Garrett v. City of Topeka, 259 Kan. 896, 916 P.2d   21 (1996), is limited to its specific facts. 266 Kan. at . In Miller v. Preisser, 295 Kan. 356, 284 P.3d   290 (2012), the court discusses the distinction between “right of access” and “regulation of traffic flow.”   The court, however, makes it clear that an unreasonable exercise of police power in exercising the right to   regulate traffic flow is not an element of compensation in eminent domain matters.       2014      "       <h4><a name='131.08' href='131.08'>131.08</a></h4><p>MEASURE OF COMPENSATION—NO MEASURABLE   MARKET VALUE—ISSUE OF FACT      Comment      This instruction has been deleted.

The owner has the right to continue to use the property only for such   purposes as do not interfere with the easement.      The measure of compensation for an easement is the difference between   the market value of the entire tract immediately before the taking and the   market value of the tract burdened with the easement immediately after the   taking.      Notes on Use      The Committee believes unless there is evidence in the case that the fee burdened with the easement   retains some value to the property owner, this instruction should be unnecessary.

You will serve as   officers of this court. You are not acting as representatives of any party. The   following instructions are given to you by the court. It is your duty to follow   these instructions and determine just compensation in this proceeding based   solely upon the instructions and the information provided you consistent with   these instructions.      After executing your oath, you should undertake your duties and file a   report with the court through the clerk of the district court within 45 days   from today, unless the court upon your request before the 45 days expires   would allow additional time.      Except for incidental contact for the purpose of verifying factual   information relating to the subject real estate or to discuss scheduling matters,   in the discharge of your duties, you should avoid any meetings or discussions   with representatives of the condemnor or the property owner without first   advising the adverse party and affording both parties an opportunity to be   present. If you receive any written material from a party, you must immediately   provide that material to the adverse party.      View of Land      You are to undertake an actual view of the land to be taken and of the   remainder if a partial taking.      Hearings      You are to conduct a public hearing in the county where the condemnation   proceeding is pending. At the hearing you shall take the oral or written   testimony of the condemnor, landowner, lienholders of record, and any   party(ies) in possession.      2012      "       Notice of the hearing shall be mailed at least 14 days in advance of the   hearing to the condemnor and to each party named in the condemnation   petition filed with the court if his or her address is known or can with reasonable   diligence be located. Also, notice shall also be given by one publication in a   newspaper of general circulation in each county where the subject lands are   located at least 14 days before the hearing. If you do not meet on the day   designated in the notice, you may meet on the following day without further   notice, but otherwise a new notice shall be required with the same time   considerations as required in the original notices.      Your written notice to parties and for publication should be substantially   in compliance with the form set forth by the Judicial Council.      Fair Market Value      The term “fair market value” as used in these instructions means the   amount in terms of money that a well-informed buyer is justified in paying   and a well-informed seller is justified in accepting for property in an open   and competitive market, assuming that the parties are acting without   undue compulsion. The fair market value shall be determined by use of the   comparable sales, cost or capitalization of income appraisal methods or any   combination of such methods.      In determining fair market value you are to consider all of the possibilities   for the use of the land and interest taken, including the best and most   advantageous use to which the property is reasonably adaptable, but this best   and most advantageous use must not be speculative, conjectural, or remote.   The uses which may be considered must be so reasonably probable as to have   an effect on the fair market value of the land at the time of the taking. Unless   the court instructs you to the contrary, the time of taking means at the time   you file your award.      In determining fair market value, you are to consider the nature of the   interest condemned as described in the condemnor’s petition. Fair market   value must be determined based upon the rights acquired under that described   taking and not by any representations as to a limited use of those rights.      Determining Just Compensation      K.S.A. 26-513 provides that private property shall not be taken or   damaged for public use without just compensation. A copy of K.S.A. 26-513   is attached to these instructions. Your job and duty as an appraiser is to   determine what is just compensation.      If an entire tract of land or interest in the entire tract is taken, the measure   of compensation you are to apply is the fair market value of the property or   interest at the time of the taking.      If only a part of a tract of land or interest is taken, the compensation and   measure of damages are the difference between the fair market value of the   entire property or interest immediately before the taking, and the value of   that portion or portions of the tract or interest remaining immediately after   the taking.      2016                   K.S.A. 26-513(d) sets out the factors you must consider in determining   just compensation for the taking. In addition to the statutory factors, you   may consider any other evidence or factor which a buyer or seller would   consider in determining the value of the property. Remember that the factors   found by you to affect the value of the property are not to be considered as   separate items of damage, but are to be considered only as they affect the total   compensation to be awarded. In other words, your duty is to appraise each   tract or parcel and the interests therein as a whole.      Additional Instructions      If you have any questions regarding your duties or these instructions or   need additional information, do not hesitate to ask the court for assistance.   Your questions or inquiries should be placed in written form to provide   documentation.      Compensation and Expenses      You should maintain a record of your time, costs and expenses. You   should file your itemizations together with your appraisers’ report with the   clerk of the County District Court. The court has the responsibility   to then determine the amount of fees and costs to be allowed.      The above instructions were given by the undersigned district judge to   the appraisers appointed in this proceeding on this day of ;      Judge      Acknowledgment by Appraisers      We, the undersigned appraisers in the above-styled proceeding do hereby   acknowledge receiving the above instructions of law from the court on this   day of ; ;      Appraiser   Appraiser      Appraiser      "      2016      "       Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 26-505.

RULES OF LIABILITY      <h4><a name='132.01' href='132.01'>132.01</a></h4><p>FELA—GENERAL STATUTORY RULE OF LIABILITY      The federal law under which the plaintiff claims the right to recover   damages in this action provides that a common carrier by railroad, while   engaged in interstate commerce, shall be liable in damages whenever its   employee is (injured) (killed) while engaged in the course of (his) (her)   employment and (injury) (death) results in whole or in part [from the negligence   of any of the officers, agents, or employees of the railroad] [by reason of any   defect or insufficiency due to the railroad’s negligence, in its (... machinery,   roadbed, equipment, etc.)].      [It is established that, at all times material to this action, the defendant   was a common carrier by railroad engaged in interstate commerce; that the   plaintiff was an employee of the defendant engaged in such commerce; and   that this action is governed by the provisions of the Federal law.]      Notes on Use      The first paragraph of the instruction must be modified by the proper material in parentheses and   brackets to fit the charges of negligence to be submitted to the jury. If the case involves only allegations   charging negligence of an employee, the phrase concerning equipment should be omitted. The last phrase   concerning equipment should be completed by the appropriate words of the statute. These words are “cars,   engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves or other equipment.”     Because the statute and instruction use the phrase “while engaged in the course of his employment,”   PIK 4" , Course of Employment as a Matter of Law, or PIK 4" , Course of Employment as a   Question of Fact, should be used with this instruction.      In the usual case there are no factual issues as to whether the defendant was a common carrier by   railroad in interstate commerce and as to whether the plaintiff was employed in such commerce. In such   cases, the bracketed optional paragraph of the instruction may be used to clarify these points. If such issues   exist, the instruction should be modified by the definitional language of 53 Stat. 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 51   (1964).     This instruction should be accompanied by PIK 4" , which defines negligence. No additional   instruction on causation, such as PIK 4" , is needed, for the statutory language “results in whole or   in part,” is sufficient under the FELA. For further discussion and authorities on causation see the second   paragraph of the comment to this instruction.     If jurors have had experience in the trial of negligence actions under state law, it may be advisable   to instruct them to disregard any conceptions they may have with respect to the law of negligence gained   from instructions in those cases. See PIK 4 - for general cautionary instructions.      2008      "      2008      Comment      The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), 53 Stat. 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 51, 54 (1964), 35   Stat. 65 (1908), 45 U.S.C. 52 (1964); 35 Stat. 66 (1908), 45 U.S.C. 53, 55, 57, 58 (1964); 62 Stat. 989   (1948), 45 U.S.C. 56 (1964); 36 Stat. 291 (1910), 45 U.S.C. 59 (1964), governs an action for damages for   injury or death of a railroad employee engaged in interstate commerce. The basis of recovery can be either   common-law negligence (PIK 4" -), as codified by the FELA, or a violation of the Safety   Appliance Act, 49 U.S.C. 20306 (2000), (PIK 4" ), or both. Authority for instructions on both   theories may be found in Gowins v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 299 F.2d 431 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 371   U.S. 824, 83 S. Ct. 44, 9 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1962). The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are   controlling as to the interpretation and effect of both the FELA and the Safety Appliance Act. Underwood   v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Rid. Co., 191 Kan. 338, 381 P.2d 510 (1963).      The special features of the FELA make the statutory action significantly different from the ordinary   common-law negligence action. It is clear that the FELA is to be uniformly construed and applied by   both state and federal tribunals following the judicial precedents established by the U. S. Supreme Court.   What constitutes negligence and causation under the FELA is a federal question and does not vary with   the differing principles of negligence applicable under state and local laws for other purposes. Federal   decisional law governs. See Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 69 S. Ct. 1018, 93 L. Ed. 1282 (1949). Thus,   because of the “in whole or in part” language of the FELA, the traditional doctrine of proximate cause   is not applicable. Eg/saer v. Scandrett, 151 F.2d 562 (7th Cir. 1945). A railroad is liable if its negligence   played any part, even the slightest, in producing the employee’s injury. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.,   352 U.S. 500, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1957), reh. denied 353 U.S. 943, 77 S. Ct. 808, 1 L. Ed. 2d   764 (1957). An instruction is sometimes requested that the plaintiff cannot recover if his negligence was   “the sole and proximate cause” of the injury or death. Such an instruction is incorrect because of the use of   the word “proximate,” as pointed out above. The so-called “sole cause” instruction adds nothing except the   possibility of confusion of the issues. The plaintiff is entitled to recover if his injury was caused “in whole   or in part” by negligence of the defendant (or by a violation of the Safety Appliance Act). If the only cause   of his injury was his own negligence, then he is not entitled to recover. “Sole cause” or “sole proximate   cause” instructions are similar to the “accident” instruction; see Comment, PIK 4" , Unavoidable   Accident. Page v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co., 349 F.2d 820 (Sth Cir. 1965). In Ross v. St Louis & S. F R. Co.,   93 Kan. 517, 144 P. 844 (1914), an order granting a new trial was affirmed because the instruction, “if   you find ... negligence of the deceased ... was the sole and proximate cause of his death ... you should find   for defendant,” was held to misstate the law and to contain language that was unclear and confusing. An   excellent discussion of causation under the FELA may be found in Egisaer v. Scandrett, 151 F.2d 562 (7th   Cir. 1945) and Page v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co., 349 F.2d 820 (Sth Cir. 1965).     In a Federal Employers’ Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51 et seq. (1988) action, the plaintiff has a   lower standard of proof of causation than under a common-law tort theory. The relaxed standard of proof   of causation under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act does not obviate the need for expert opinion   testimony in certain cases. When the conclusion of causation is not within the common knowledge of a   jury, expert testimony is required. Knowles v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., 18 Kan. App. 2d 608, 856 P.2d   1352 (1993).     To maintain a claim under FELA, an employee is required to prove that the railroad was his employer,   at the time of his injury. Federal Employers’ Liability Act, §§ 1 et seq., 45 U.S.C. §§ 51 et seg. Doughty v.   CSX Transportation, Inc., 258 Kan. 493, 905 P.2d 106 (1995).     The common-law defense of contributory negligence is unavailable as a complete defense to the   statutory action and operates only to diminish the plaintiff’s recovery. See PIK 4% , Contributory   Negligence Not an Issue, and Comment. Further, assumption of risk has been abolished as a bar to   recovery, 53 Stat. 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 54 (1964). Important changes were written into the FELA in the   1939 amendment, 53 Stat. 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 51 (1964), with respect to those employees engaged   in interstate commerce and in abolishing the defense of assumption of risk. Cases decided prior to this                            "      amendment should not be considered as authority on these subjects. When an action is based on a violation   of the Safety Appliance Act or Boiler Inspection Act, it is not necessary to show negligence, for a violation   supplies the act necessary for a finding of railroad liability. See PIK 4" - and Comment. A   general discussion of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act may be found in an article by Richter and Forer,   Federal Employers’ Liability Act, 12 FRD 13 (1951).     In an action filed under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51 et seq. (1988), physical   impact under the “zone of danger test” contemplates an impact relating to the resulting emotional distress.   Where evidence establishes that plaintiff experienced no fear for his or her personal safety and that the   physical impact did not cause injury and did not have any effect on plaintiff’s resulting severe emotional   distress, plaintiff’s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress fails. Grube v. Union Pacific R.R.   Co., 256 Kan. 519, 886 P.2d 845 (1994).      The joinder of a FELA action with a common-law action has been sustained. Bankson v. Illinois   Cent. R. Co,. 196 Fed. 171 (N.D. Iowa, 1912). In such cases the principles applicable to contributory   negligence for both actions are less confusing if stated in one instruction. No cases of this nature have been   found in Kansas and it is believed the situation will arise so rarely that an instruction is not needed in this   work.

What constitutes safe and suitable (tools) (machinery) (appliances)   depends on the risk involved in the work and all of the circumstances then   existing.      Comment      The railroad has a duty to exercise reasonable care to furnish its employees with reasonably safe tools   and appliances. This duty does not require it to furnish the newest or even the safest and most approved   devices if the employee is not deceived as to the degree of danger to which he is subjected. McGivern v.   Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 132 F.2d 213 (8th Cir. 1942).     A railroad engaged in interstate commerce has a duty under the FELA to furnish its employees   with a reasonably safe place to work and safe equipment to work with, and a failure to do so constitutes   negligence. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co. v. Brown, 348 P.2d 1069 (Okla 1959).      Two leading U. S. Supreme Court cases on this subject are Honeycutt v. Wabash Railroad Company,   303 S.W.2d 153 (Mo.

Ed. 2d 721 (mandamus petition granted on question of conforming state court decision to that of U. S.   Supreme Court, Deen v. Hickman, 358 U.S. 57, 79 S. Ct. 1, 3 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1958)). In the Honeycutt case   the employee was operating a rivet gun under a car when the trigger caught on an unknown object and   discharged a metal clip, causing injury. The Supreme Court held that proofs justified with reason the jury’s   conclusion that the employer’s negligence had played a part in producing the employee’s injury. In the   Deen case the employee’s injuries were inflicted by falling babbitt and it was held that proofs justified the   conclusion that the employer’s negligence played a part in producing the employee’s injury.     It is the nondelegable obligation of the employer under the FELA to provide a sufficient number of   workers for a particular task. In Southern Ry. Co. v. Welch, 247 F.2d 340 (6th Cir.1957), the employer’s   negligence in not providing assistance for the task in question was held to have played some part in the   injury. A protest or request by the employee for additional help may, considered with other circumstances,   constitute evidence of the employer’s negligence.     If it is alleged that the negligence of the railroad was a failure to comply with the duty to furnish   sufficient employees for the job, the above instruction should be modified accordingly.     It has been held that res ipsa loquitur applies in FELA cases. The res ipsa loquitur doctrine is simply   a rule of evidence and like any other rule of evidence it is brought into play where the situation presented   makes it applicable. See Miller v. Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Ry. Co., 317 F.2d 693 (6th   Cir. 1963), and the following annotations: Res Ipsa Loquitur in Federal Employers’ Liability Act Cases,   35 A.L.R. 2d 475; Liability Under Federal Employers’ Liability Act, for Injury to or Death of Employee   Riding Train Resulting From Sudden Stop, Start, or Jerk of Train, 60 A.L.R. 2d 637; Res Ipsa Loquitur as   Ground for Direction of Verdict in Favor of Plaintiff, 97 A.L.R. 2d 522.      2008                 "      <h4><a name='132.03' href='132.03'>132.03</a></h4><p>FELA—COMMON-LAW DUTY TO PROVIDE A   REASONABLY SAFE PLACE TO WORK      It is the duty of a railroad to use reasonable care to provide its employees   with a safe place to work. The degree of care depends upon the danger involved   in the work and all the circumstances then existing.      Comment      Arailroad engaged in interstate commerce has the duty to use reasonable care to furnish its employees   with a safe place in which to work. Rubley v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 208 F. Supp. 798 (DC Tenn.   1962).     The duty to use reasonable care in providing a safe place to work is nondelegable, actual notice is   not indispensable, and constructive notice is sufficient. Security Ins. Co. of New Haven v. Johnson, 276 F.2d   182 (10th Cir. 1960). See PIK 4" , FELA—Notice of Defective Condition.      The common-law duty of the employer to use reasonable care in furnishing the employee with a safe   place to work becomes more imperative as the risk increases. In all cases it is a question of reasonableness   of care depending on the danger attending the place or the machinery. The duty to furnish a safe place to   work is a continuing one from which the carrier is not relieved by the fact that the employee’s work at the   place in question is fleeting or infrequent. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., Inc., 319 U.S. 350, 63 S. Ct. 1062,   87 L. Ed. 1444 (1943).     A FELA case illustrative of the duty to provide a safe place to work and sufficient materials, such as   sand, gravel, salt, etc., to decrease the danger from ice and snow when it can reasonably be done, is Chicago   & North Western Railway Company v. Rieger, 326 F.2d 329 (8th Cir. 1964), cert. denied 377 U.S. 917, 84   S. Ct. 1182, 12 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1964). Evidence of a railroad’s direction to complete a job in 30 minutes,   plus the inexperience of the brakeman assigned to the job, was sufficient to present a jury question of the   negligence of the railroad in Davis v. Virginian R. Co., 361 U.S. 354, 80 S. Ct. 387, 4 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1960),   which case illustrates that a railroad’s duty to provide a safe place for work includes a duty to furnish safe   methods of work.      2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='132.04' href='132.04'>132.04</a></h4><p>FELA—NOTICE OF DEFECTIVE CONDITION      Before you may find a railroad liable for the (injury) (death) of an employee   resulting from a defective condition in (equipment) ([his] [her] place of work),   you must be satisfied that the railroad had either actual or constructive notice   of the defective condition and that it had a reasonable opportunity to remove   or repair the defect before the occurrence involved in this action.      Actual notice of a condition is said to exist when one has direct information   of the condition. Constructive notice of a condition is said to exist when the   condition is plainly visible or has existed long enough that by the use of   reasonable care it should have been discovered. The legal effect of constructive   notice is the same as actual notice.      To find that a railroad had notice, actual or constructive, of a defective   condition, you must be satisfied that such notice was received (by an employee   who was authorized to repair or remedy such condition) (by an employee   having a duty to report such condition to one in authority) (by a person who, in   a reasonable delegation of responsibility, ought to have had such authority or      duty).      Notes on Use      This instruction applies only to negligence actions under the FELA (PIK 4" -) that are   based on defective conditions in equipment or the place of work. It does not apply to actions based upon   the Safety Appliance or Boiler Inspection Acts (PIK 4" - ). The instruction must be modified   for particular cases by the appropriate words or phrases in the parentheses.      Comment      The question of notice under the FELA has been held to be one for the jury. In one of the leading   cases on this subject, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a judgment for a plaintiff   in a FELA case on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to present a jury question of negligence.   Webb v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 228 F.2d 257 (7th Cir. 1955). The U. S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that   judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the   single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played   any part at all in the injury or death. Judges are to fix their sights, it seems, to make that appraisal, and, if   the test is met, are bound to find that a case for a jury is made out whether or not the evidence allows the   jury a choice of other probabilities. Webb v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 352 U.S. 512, 77 S. Ct. 451, 1 L. Ed. 2d   503 (1957), reh. denied 353 U.S. 943, 77 S. Ct. 809, 1 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1957). This view is in accord with   the view expressed by Chief Justice Horton in the early Kansas case of Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Holt,   29 Kan. 149 (1883).     In determining the question of whether or not silicosis caused by inhalation of dust from a faulty   locomotive sanding apparatus was compensable under the FELA, the U. S. Supreme Court stated that it   was for the jury to determine whether the defendant railroad had knowledge, actual or constructive, of the                            "      alleged inadequacies of the equipment which caused the injury. Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 69 S. Ct.   1018, 93 L. Ed. 1282 (1949).     In an action brought by an employee under the FELA on a negligence theory charging the railroad   with a failure to provide a safe place to work, the Federal District Court of Pennsylvania held that the   common-law concept of the employer’s duty to provide a safe place to work requires the employer to have   actual or constructive notice of a defective condition. The court instructed the jury that it could not find the   defendant negligent unless it also found that the defendant knew or should have known of the condition   prior to the accident. Fassbinder v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 193 F. Supp. 767 (DC Pa. 1961), revd. on other   grounds 322 F.2d 859 (3rd Cir. 1963); Kaminski v. Chicago River & Indiana R. Co., 200 F.2d 1 (7th Cir.   1952).      In an action against a railroad by an employee under the FELA for damages for occupational   dermatitis allegedly resulting from exposure to diesel fuel oil, whether a railroad could or might have   known of dangers to its employees from exposure to diesel oils and chromates contained therein were held   to be questions of fact for a jury. Crowley v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., 1 Ill. App. 2d 481, 117 N.E.2d   843 (1954), cert. denied 348 U.S. 927, 75 S. Ct. 340, 99 L. Ed. 727 (1955).      A railroad cannot be held negligent in the absence of proof that a defect had been known, or should   have been known, and that there had been an opportunity to correct it. The establishment of such elements,   however, may come from the proof of facts permitting a jury inference that the defect had been discovered,   or should have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care or inspection. Miller v. Cincinnati, New   Orleans and Texas Pacific Ry. Co., 317 F.2d 693 (6th Cir. 1963).     A railroad has a duty to inspect cars belonging to another railroad for defects before permitting its   employees to work with them. The contention that there was no opportunity to obtain actual or constructive   notice is not a defense. Shenker v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 374 U.S. 1, 83 S. Ct. 1667, 10 L. Ed. 2d 709   (1963).      2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='132.05' href='132.05'>132.05</a></h4><p>SAFETY APPLIANCE ACT—AUTOMATIC COUPLER      The federal law under which the plaintiff claims the right to recover   damages in this action imposes an absolute duty upon a railroad to have all   of the cars it uses or allows to be used on its line equipped with couplers that   will be automatically coupled by impact and that can be uncoupled without   the necessity of workmen going between the ends of the cars.      This law is violated when a coupler fails to function properly (when used   or operated in the usual and customary manner) (because of a defect).      Whenever a railroad employee is (injured) (killed) in the course of (his)   (her) employment and the (injury) (death) results in whole or in part from a   violation of the duty imposed by this law, the plaintiff is entitled to recover   damages for such (injury) (death) even though the railroad was not negligent   and even though the (plaintiff) (decedent) was negligent.      Notes on Use      The instruction is based on 49 U.S.C. 20302(a)(1)(A) (2000). The instruction should be made to   conform to the evidence by use of one or both of the phrases in parentheses in the second paragraph. The   phrase “in the course of employment” in the last paragraph may be omitted when no fact issue exists on   this point. If a fact issue is presented as to whether interstate commerce was involved, or as to whether a   car was being used on a railroad’s line, the instruction should be modified to cover such an issue.      Comment      The duty imposed by the Safety Appliance Act on a railroad operating in interstate commerce is   absolute. The presence or absence of negligence of a railroad is immaterial in establishing a violation of   the act. Hallada v. Great Northern Railway, 244 Minn. 81, 69 N.W.2d 673 (1955), cert denied 350 U.S.   874, 76 S. Ct. 119, 100 L. Ed. 773. In a Kansas case tried under the Safety Appliance Act, Underwood v.   Missouri-Kansas-Texas Rid. Co., 191 Kan. 338, 381 P.2d 510 (1963), the Kansas Supreme Court quoted   from Brady v. Terminal R. R. Assn., 303 U.S. 10, 58 S. Ct. 426, 82 L. Ed. 614 (1938), as follows: “ ... The   statutory liability (in relation to the use of a defective car) is not based upon the carrier’s negligence. The   duty imposed is an absolute one and the carrier is not excused by any showing of care however assiduous.”   A railroad’s violation of the Safety Appliance Act, 49 U.S.C. 20306 (2000), supplies the wrongful   act necessary to find the railroad liable. Carter v. Atlanta & St. A. B. R. Co., 338 U.S. 430, 70 S. Ct. 226, 94   L. Ed. 236 (1949).      In an action under the Safety Appliance Act, based upon the alleged improper operation of an   automatic coupler, compliance with the statutory duty is tested by the performance of the appliance. “The   failure of a coupler to work at any time sustains a charge that the Act has been violated.... That duty is   absolute and unqualified and contemplates the maintenance of such appliances in working condition at all   times.” Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co. v. Auchenbach, 16 F.2d 550 (3d Cir. 1926), cert. denied 273 U.S. 761, 47   S. Ct. 476, 71 L. Ed. 878 (1927).                             "      Although in most cases under this section of the Safety Appliance Act the employee is injured as a   result of going between cars, the place of his injury is not a necessary element to establish a violation of   the act. For example see Penn v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co., 163 F.2d 995 (7th Cir. 1947), revd 335 U.S.   849, 69 S. Ct. 79, 93 L. Ed. 398, reh. denied 335 U.S. 873, 69 S. Ct. 164, 93 L. Ed. 417 (1948), where the   employee was running beside a car in attempting to use a pin lifter and stepped into a space between a   switch rod and tie, injuring himself. The Act also requires couplers that will remain coupled until set free   by some purposeful act of control. O’Donnell v. Elgin J. & E. R. Co., 338 U.S. 384, 70 S. Ct. 200, 94 L. Ed.   187 (1949), reh. denied 338 U.S. 945, 70 S. Ct. 427, 94 L. Ed. 583 (1950). See Comment to PIK 4" ,   FELA—Common—Law Duty to Provide Safe Tools and Machinery, with regard to applicability of res ipsa   loquitur in FELA cases.     The relationship between the FELA, Safety Appliance Act, and the Boiler Inspection Act is explained   in Carter v. Atlanta & St. A. B. R. Co., 338 U.S. 430, 70 S. Ct. 226, 94 L. Ed. 236 (1949).     When violations of the Safety Appliance and the Boiler Inspection Acts are involved, contributory   negligence may not be considered in mitigation of damages. 35 Stat. 66 (1908), 45 U.S.C. 53 (1964). The   defense of assumption of risk has also been abolished under the FELA, 53 Stat. 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 54   (1964), and under the Safety Appliance Act, 49 U.S.C. 20304 (2000).      When evidence tends to support allegations of negligence and violation of the Safety Appliance   Act, a plaintiff is entitled to have both instructions given, but a clear separation of the two kinds of actions   should be observed to make a clear charge to the jury. As a practical matter an election to submit the case   on one theory or the other is usually made at the conclusion of the evidence. O ‘Donnell v. Elgin J. & E. R.   Co., 338 U.S. 384, 70 S. Ct. 200, 94 L. Ed. 187 (1949). It is not mandatory, however, that the plaintiff make   an election between the two theories of recovery at the close of the evidence. Flanigan v. Hines, 108 Kan.   133, 193 P. 1077 (1920).     Regulations made by the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to statutory authority were held   to have the same force as those prescribed by statute. Atchison, T. & S. F R. Co. v. Scarlett, 300 U.S. 471, 57   S. Ct. 541, 81 L. Ed. 748 (1937), reh. denied 301 U.S. 712, 57 S. Ct. 787, 81 L. Ed. 1365 (1937). The duties   of the ICC under the Safety Appliance Act subsequently were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation.   When pertinent regulations are in evidence, a jury may be instructed in substantially the following form:   “The Secretary of Transportation, acting under authority of law, has made certain regulations which are   to be considered as having the same effect as the law contained in instruction [PIK 16.01-.08 ... ].” This   may then be followed with a summary of the appropriate ICC regulation. An instruction in this form was   approved in Underwood v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Rid. Co., 191 Kan. 338, 381 P.2d 510 (1963).      2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='132.06' href='132.06'>132.06</a></h4><p>SAFETY APPLIANCE ACT—HANDBRAKES      The federal law under which the plaintiff claims the right to recover   damages in this action imposes upon a railroad an absolute duty to have each   railroad car that it uses or allows to be used on its line, equipped with efficient   handbrakes.      This law is violated when handbrakes fail to function properly (when   used or operated in the usual and customary manner) (because of a defect).      Whenever a railroad employee is (injured) (killed) in the course of (his)   (her) employment and the (injury) (death) results in whole or in part from a   violation of the duty imposed by the law, the plaintiff is entitled to recover   damages for such (injury) (death) even though the railroad was not negligent   and even though the (plaintiff) (decedent) was negligent.      Notes on Use      See 49 U.S.C. 20302(a)(1)(B) (2000). The same subsection also requires secure sill steps. See Notes   on Use under PIK 4" , Safety Appliance Act—Automatic Coupler.      Comment      See Comment under PIK 4" , Safety Appliance Act—Automatic Coupler.     There are two recognized methods of showing the inefficiency of equipment. It may be established   by evidence showing some particular defect, or it may be established by showing that the equipment failed   to function when operated in the normal, natural, and usual manner. Myers v. Reading Co., 331 U.S. 477,   67 S. Ct. 1334, 91 L. Ed. 1615 (1947). It is sufficient to show that the brake did not work at the time of the   injury, even though it may have worked both before and after the injury.                              <h4><a name='132.07' href='132.07'>132.07</a></h4><p>SAFETY APPLIANCE ACT—GRABIRONS      The federal law under which the plaintiff claims the right to recover   damages in this action imposes upon a railroad an absolute duty to have all of   the cars that it uses or allows to be used on its line, equipped with secure and   adequate grabirons or handholds at the ends and sides of each car (and on the   roof at the top of the ladder on each car).     This statute is violated (when a car does not have the required grabirons   or handholds) (when a grabiron or handhold on a car is not secure or adequate   for use).     Whenever a railroad employee is (injured) (killed) in the course of (his)   (her) employment and the (injury) (death) results in whole or in part from a   violation of the duty imposed by the law, the plaintiff is entitled to recover   damages for such (injury) (death) even though the railroad was not negligent   and even though the (plaintiff) (decedent) was negligent.

Whenever a railroad employee is (injured) (killed) in the course of (his)   (her) employment and the (injury) (death) results in whole or in part from a   violation of the duty imposed by this law, the plaintiff is entitled to recover   damages for such (injury) (death) even though the railroad was not negligent   and even though the (plaintiff) (decedent) was negligent.      Notes on Use      This instruction covers violations of 49 U.S.C. 20701 (2000), which originally was called the Boiler   Inspection Act. See generally the Notes on Use under PIK 4" , Safety Appliance Act—Automatic   Coupler.      Comment      See Comment under PIK 4" , Safety Appliance Act—Automatic Coupler. The effect of the   Boiler Inspection Act is the same as that of the Safety Appliance Act in imposing an absolute duty on   railroads. An injured employee need only prove that a locomotive was not in proper condition and safe to   operate. Lilly v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 317 U.S. 481, 63 S. Ct. 347, 87 L. Ed. 411 (1943).     The Boiler Inspection Act covers not only defects in construction and mechanical operation, but   gives protection against the presence of dangerous objects and foreign matter. For example, in Gowins v.   Pennsylvania R. Co., 299 F.2d 431 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 371 U.S. 824, 83 S. Ct. 44, 9 L. Ed. 2d   64 (1962), it was held that a trial court had erred in withdrawing from jury consideration an employee’s   claim, under the Boiler Inspection Act, that he had “slipped and tripped” because there had been oil on the   locomotive walkways he had been required to use.                              "      <h4><a name='132.09' href='132.09'>132.09</a></h4><p>EFFECT OF COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS      Reference has been made in this case to certain rules adopted by the   railroad for the safety of its employees. These rules were not admitted into   evidence as legal standards of duty but as evidence of the degree of reasonable   care to be exercised on the part of either the plaintiff or the defendant in   situations to which the rules apply.      [When a rule has been customarily violated, with the knowledge of those   whose duty it was to enforce the rules or to report their violations, the rule   may be regarded as inoperative.]|      Notes on Use      This instruction is optional and should be used only in cases in which work or safety rules are in   evidence either on the question of the negligence of the railroad or on the question of the contributory   negligence of the employee. The bracketed paragraph should be included only when it is contended that   there has been a waiver of a rule by customary or habitual violation.      Comment      A violation of a railroad work rule may be considered by a jury as evidence of negligent conduct,   either on the part of the defendant railroad or on the part of the employee, depending on the factual situation.   Several cases illustrative of this point are cited below.      In a FELA case, the Kansas Supreme Court held that evidence that a section motorcar had been   operated in violation of a company’s speed rules was evidence of a negligent rate of speed. Tschreppel v.   Missouri-K-T. Rid. Co., 134 Kan. 251, 5 P.2d 845 (1931), cert. denied 286 U.S. 549, 52 S. Ct. 501, 76 L.   Ed. 1285 (1932).      In a railway crossing case, a trial court had properly instructed a jury in substance that the observance   or nonobservance of rules for the operation of trains was not conclusive as to the negligence or care of a   railroad or its employees, but was only a circumstance to be considered in determining whether or not the   defendant was negligent. Rules are not admissible as legal standards of duty, but are admissible as some   evidence of the measure of caution that ought to be exercised in situations to which the rules apply. Deister   v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 99 Kan. 525, 162 P. 282 (1917).      In an action under the FELA, a violation ofa rule of a railroad company does not constitute negligence   or contributory negligence as a matter of law. It is for the jury to determine whether a violation is a cause   that contributed in part or in whole to the accident in issue. Teets v. Chicago, South Shore & South Bend R.,   238 F.2d 223 (7th Cir. 1956). It is for the jury to determine whether violation of or obedience to the rules,   under the evidence as a whole, shows negligence or lack of negligence. Frabutt v. New York C. & St. L. R.   Co., 88 F. Supp. 821 (DC Pa. 1950).     The question of waiver of rules was discussed in an early FELA case in Kansas. In that case, it was   held that disobedience with respect to a work rule may be considered on a question of the negligence of a   railroad or on a question of the contributory negligence of an employee. On the question of an employee’s   contributory negligence, the court said: “It is presumed a rule is made for the purpose of being heeded, but      2008      "       when it is so continuously or habitually disregarded as to convince jurors that it has been waived it is not   only sense and justice that they may so conclude but it is the law.” For a detailed discussion of the question   of rule waiver and citation of authority, see Duncan v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 86 Kan. 112, 113, 116,   117, 119 P. 356 (1911).      2008       "      B. COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT      <h4><a name='132.10' href='132.10'>132.10</a></h4><p>COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW      At the time of the occurrence involved in this case the (plaintiff) (decedent)   was in the course of (his) (her) employment.      Notes on Use      This instruction should be given when there is no question of fact as to whether the plaintiff was in   the course of his employment. The instructions with respect to PIK 4" -, Rules of Liability,   contain the FELA liability requirement that a plaintiff or decedent be injured or killed “in the course of   his employment.” When, as in most cases, no such issue is raised, any question concerning it should be   eliminated from a jury’s consideration.      Comment      See also Comment under PIK 4" , Course of Employment as a Question of Fact.     Generally a trial court should decide the jurisdictional question of whether an employee is engaged   in the furtherance of interstate commerce so that he might invoke the provisions of the federal statute.   The federal decisions on this subject now cover a broad area and the question is primarily a question of   law. Where the facts pertaining to an injury sustained by an employee of a carrier engaged in interstate   commerce have been established, the question whether the employee was subject to the FELA is one of   law. Skanks v. Union Pac. Rid. Co., 155 Kan. 584, 127 P.2d 431 (1942). Only in a rare case will a railroad   employee’s duties not be in the furtherance of interstate commerce by the railroad.     To maintain a claim under FELA, an employee is required to prove that the railroad was his employer,   at the time of his injury. Federal Employers’ Liability Act, §§ 1 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A. §§ 51 et seg. Doughty   v.

Comment      See also Comment under PIK 4" , Course of Employment as a Matter of Law.      The FELA has broadened considerably the traditional scope of the employer-employee relationship.   This may have been because railroading requires that a wide variety of activities, otherwise personal, be   done on the job.     Cases illustrating activities held to have been within an employee’s scope of employment under the   FELA include Chicago, M. St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Kane, 33 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1929), cert. denied 280 U.S.   588, 50 S. Ct. 37, 74 L. Ed. 637 (1929); Mostyn v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 160 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1947),   cert. denied 332 U.S. 770, 68 S.

To maintain a claim under FELA, an employee was required to prove that the railroad was his   employer, at the time of his injury. Federal Employers’ Liability Act, §§ 1 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A. §§ 51 et seq.;   Doughty v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 258 Kan. 493, 905 P.2d 106 (1995).     Where a railway employee was injured in loading a barrel of oil on a truck, which oil was used   in oiling the employer’s railroad engines, his right of redress was governed by the FELA and not by the   Workmen’s Compensation Act. Harris v. Missouri Pac. Rid. Co., 158 Kan. 679, 149 P.2d 342 (1944).     A railway employee who slipped and fell while walking from the office where he checked in to the   roundhouse where he worked on engines used in interstate transportation was under the FELA and not   the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Williams v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 155 Kan. 813, 130 P.2d 596   (1942).     The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has held that “course of employment” within FELA is not   limited to actual work done but includes passage across an employer’s premises to and from a place of   work where it is a necessary incident to the day’s work. Morris v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 187 F.2d 837 (2d   Cir. 1951).

Notes on Use      With this instruction give either PIK 4" , Course of Employment as a Matter of Law or PIK   4" , Course of Employment as a Question of Fact, defining course of employment. In case scope of   employment is an issue as to the railroad employee claimed to have been negligent, it is suggested that a   sentence be added after the first sentence of the instruction as follows: “A corporation is responsible for   the negligent acts of its officers and employees only when such persons are acting within the scope of their   employment.”       2008      "      2008      C.

Notes on Use      This instruction should be given when contributory negligence is an issue of fact for the jury. The   burden of proof on this issue should be set out in the issue and burden of proof instruction. See PIK 4"   , Issues and Burden of Proof—Plaintiff’s Claim—Defendant’s Defense.     This instruction should not be given in Safety Appliance Act or Boiler Inspection Act cases. See PIK   4" , Contributory Negligence—Violation of Safety Appliance Act or Boiler Inspection Act.     The instruction as to the method by which damages should be adjusted for contributory negligence,   PIK 4" , Diminution of Damages Because of Contributory Negligence, should also be given when   contributory negligence is an issue.      Comment      The decisions restrict the effect of contributory negligence to that which is direct, or proximate, in   considering the diminution of damages. Keith v. Wheeling & L. E. Ry. Co., 160 F.2d 654 (6th Cir. 1947),   cert. denied 332 U.S. 763, 68 S. Ct. 67, 92 L. Ed. 348 (1947).     See Comment to PIK 4" , No Assumption of Risk by Employee, concerning the distinction   between contributory negligence (only a partial defense) and assumption of risk (no defense).     The FELA does not provide for reduction of the amount of damages payable by a liable employer   through apportionment of damages between railroad and non-railroad causes. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v.   Ayers, 538 U.S. 135, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 155 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2003). There, the trial court properly instructed   the jury “not to make a deduction for the contribution of non-railroad exposures” to asbestos, as long as it   found defendant was negligent and that “dust exposures at [Norfolk] contributed, however slightly, to the   plaintiff’s injuries.”                  "      <h4><a name='132.21' href='132.21'>132.21</a></h4><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE NOT AN ISSUE      The evidence in this case fails to show contributory negligence on the   part of the (plaintiff) (decedent), and, therefore, you should not consider the   question of contributory negligence raised by the defendant.      Notes on Use      This instruction is for use only when a jury has been told during a trial that contributory negligence   is an issue, and after it has been closed, the evidence is insufficient to justify submitting the issue to a jury.   It is not needed when no issue or mention of contributory negligence has been made at the trial.     See Comment under PIK 4" , No Assumption of Risk by Employee, concerning the distinction   between contributory negligence (only a partial defense) and assumption of risk (no defense).       2008      "      2008      <h4><a name='132.22' href='132.22'>132.22</a></h4><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE—VIOLATION OF SAFETY   APPLIANCE ACT OR BOILER INSPECTION ACT      Under the law in this case a (plaintiff’s) (decedent’s) negligence neither   prevents recovery nor serves to reduce the amount of any damages found to   have been sustained.      Notes on Use      This instruction applies to Safety Appliance Act and Boiler Inspection Act cases and is based on 35   Stat. 66 (1908), 45 U.S.C. 53 (1964). If the case includes a cause of action based upon negligence under   the FELA, the instruction must be modified to show application to only the Safety Appliance Act or Boiler   Inspection Act causes of action.      Comment      The defense of contributory negligence is entirely unavailable to a railroad in an action based upon   a violation of the Safety Appliance Act or Boiler Inspection Act. Yentzer v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 239 F.2d   785 (3d Cir. 1957).                              "      <h4><a name='132.23' href='132.23'>132.23</a></h4><p>NO ASSUMPTION OF RISK BY EMPLOYEE      The federal law under which the plaintiff claims the right to recover   in this action provides that, in any action brought against a railroad for (an   injury to) (the death of) an employee, the employee shall not be held to have   assumed the risks of (his) (her) employment.      Notes on Use      The instruction is applicable to actions based upon negligence under the FELA and upon violations   of the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts.     This instruction is based upon 53 Stat 1404 (1939), 45 U.S.C. 54 (2000) and 49 U.S.C. 20304   (2000).      Comment      The above instruction is optional and should be used only when assumption of risk has been stated   as an issue or inferred from argument or evidence introduced during trial. The giving of an instruction that   an employee had not assumed the risk of his employment has been held proper without regard to whether   the defense had been asserted, although it has also been held to have been properly refused when that was   not an issue. Wantland v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 237 F.2d 921 (7th Cir. 1956), Blundell v. Atchison, Topeka   & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 157 Cal. App. 2d 797, 322 P.2d 66 (1958). However, see Koshorek v. Pennsylvania R.   Co., 318 F.2d 364 (3d Cir. 1963), which involved an action under the FELA by a railroad shop employee. A   judgment based on a jury verdict in favor of the railroad was reversed and a new trial granted because the   trial court had failed to properly distinguish comparative negligence and assumption of risk and had failed   to instruct that the employee had not assumed the risk of his employment. The case contains an excellent   discussion of the doctrine of comparative negligence in FELA actions and of the abrogation of the defense   of assumption of risk, which abrogation necessitates a careful distinction between the two concepts.     In a FELA case in which the Illinois Pattern Instruction (Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions—Civil No.   , which is similar to PIK 4" ) on “assumed risk” was given, the defendant contended there   was nothing in the pleadings of evidence to justify the giving of an assumed risk instruction. The court held   that the use of such a cautionary instruction is a discretionary matter for the trial court. Graham v. Toledo,   Peoria & Western R. Co., 35 Ill. App. 2d 234, 182 N.E.2d 889 (1962).      2008      "       D. DAMAGES      <h4><a name='132.30' href='132.30'>132.30</a></h4><p>FELA DAMAGES IN GENERAL      Comment      When personal injuries are involved, refer to the following instructions in addition to any instructions   in this section that are particularly applicable to FELA cases:     PIK 4" , Types of Damages Allowed—Personal Injury;     PIK 4" , Aggravation of Preexisting Condition;     PIK 4" , Mortality Table—Life Expectancy.     Two special rules exclusively applicable to damages in FELA cases make additional damage   instructions necessary in this chapter. The rule that contributory negligence does not bar but only serves to   diminish damages must be the subject ofan instruction in FELA actions in which contributory negligence is a   question of fact for the jury (PIK 4" , Diminution of Damages Because of Contributory Negligence).   It should be pointed out that such an instruction is not applicable to cases based upon a violation of the   Safety Appliance or Boiler Inspection Acts, because contributory negligence does not diminish damages   for violation of those statutes. In death actions different elements of recovery are allowed under the FELA   than under Kansas law (K.S.A. 60-1904). In FELA actions PIK 4" - replace the PIK 4"    series on wrongful death. The forms of verdict and concluding instructions in Chapter  may   be used in injury or death actions under the FELA.     Damage instructions in FELA actions should be modified to reflect that the dollar value of damages   for loss of future earning capacity and future medical expenses should be reduced to present cash value.   “Present cash value” is the sum of money which, together with the reasonable future earnings of such   sum, will produce the dollar equivalent of such future damages. In short, the jury should be instructed   that when such future payments are to be anticipated the verdict should be on the basis of their present   value. Gulf C. & S. F Ry. v. Moser, 275 U.S. 133, 48 S. Ct. 49, 72 L. Ed. 200 (1927), conformed to (Tex.   Civ.App.) 4 S.W.2d 1118. In a Federal Employers’ Liability Act action, the employer is entitled to have   the jury instructed that an award for future economic loss must be on the basis of its present value. Koser   v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 261 Kan. 46, 928 P.2d 85 (1996). Damages for future pain and   suffering are not reduced to present cash value. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Buckles, 232 F.2d 257 (5th Cir.   1956) cert. denied 351 U.S. 984, 76 S. Ct. 1052, 100 L. Ed. 1498 (1956).      The elements of damages recoverable in FELA cases are a matter of federal law. However, the   method of proof of the present value of future damages, like other questions of procedure and evidence, is   to be determined by the law of the forum. Gannaway v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Rid. Co., 2 Kan. App. 2d   81, 575 P.2d 566 (1978).     The legal effect of benefits received by an employee under the Railroad Retirement Act have been   fully and finally put to rest in Eichel v. New York Central R. Co., 375 U.S. 253, 84 S. Ct. 316, 11 L. Ed. 2d   307 (1963). In a per curiam opinion the Court quoted from an earlier case as follows:     “The Railroad Retirement Act is substantially a Social Security Act for employees   of common carriers.... The benefits received under such a system of social legislation are   not directly attributable to the contributions of the employer, so they cannot be considered   in mitigation of the damages caused by the employer.” New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v.      2008                   Leary, 204 F.2d 461, 468 (1st Cir. 1953), cert. denied 346 U.S. 856, 74 S. Ct. 71, 98 L.   Ed. 370 (1953).      Also, in the Eichel case, the Supreme Court discussed the value of disability benefits on the issue of   malingering. It wrote:     “Insofar as the evidence bears on the issue of malingering, there will generally be   other evidence having more probative value and involving less likelihood of prejudice   than the receipt of a disability pension. Moreover, it would violate the spirit of the federal   statutes if the receipt of disability benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, 50   Stat. 309, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 228b(a)4, were considered as evidence of malingering   by an employee asserting a claim under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act...”     If there are arguments or inferences that receipt of such benefits affects the merits of the case, then   a precautionary instruction similar to PIK 4" , No Assumption of Risk by Employee, should be   given.     In a FELA wrongful death case the Supreme Court held that the Illinois trial court erred in (1)   excluding evidence of income taxes payable on the decedent’s past and estimated future earnings, and (2)   in refusing to instruct the jury that their award would be nontaxable. Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Liepelt,   444 U.S. 490, 100 S. Ct. 755, 62 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1980) rev. denied 445 U.S. 972, 100 S. Ct. 1667, 64 L. Ed.   2d 250.      A claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress may be advanced under FELA. If an employee   suffers only emotional injury, it constitutes an injury resulting from the employer’s negligence only if (1)   the injury was caused by fear of physical injury to the employee resulting from the employer’s conduct,   and (2) the employee was within the zone of danger of physical impact. Consolidated Rail Corporation   v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1994) (plaintiff who suffered no physical   injury not entitled to recover for emotional distress due to witnessing death of co-worker). See also Grube   v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 256 Kan. 519, 886 P.2d 845 (1994).      Gotshall, supra, was applied in Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424, 117 S. Ct.   2113, 138 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1997), to deny recovery for fear of contracting cancer by a worker who had been   exposed to asbestos as a result of defendant’s negligence but who was disease-free.     Gotshall and Buckley, supra, apply to free-standing claims of mental anguish by those who have   suffered no physical injury or disease. When the worker is entitled to recover for a physical injury or   disease caused in part by defendant’s negligence, the worker may also recover for related emotional   distress. Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Ayers, 583 U.S. 135, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 155 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2003). In   Norfolk, plaintiffs developed the disease asbestosis in part because of defendant’s negligence in exposing   them to asbestos. The court held they were entitled to recover damages resulting from a reasonable fear of   developing cancer stemming from their present disease. The trial court instructed the jury, “Any plaintiff   who has demonstrated that he had developed a reasonable fear of cancer is entitled to be compensated for   that fear as a part of the damages you may award for pain and suffering.” Norfolk suggests that defendant   would be entitled to an instruction that “plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to be genuine and serious.”     While Norfolk, supra, permits recovery of damages for fear of contacting cancer, it notes that   plaintiffs did not seek and the trial court did not allow damages to be recovered for the increased risk of   cancer by those who have developed asbestosis. No asbestosis claimant was shown to be reasonably certain   to contract cancer and most courts follow the “separate disease rule,” permitting a later action seeking   additional damages if the worker subsequently contracts cancer.

Notes on Use      Adapt this instruction to a death action or action for personal injuries by using the proper words in   parentheses. Do not give this instruction in a case based upon a violation of the Safety Appliance or Boiler   Inspection Acts because contributory negligence does not diminish damages for violation of those statutes.   The instruction is based upon 35 Stat. 66 (1908), 45 U.S.C. 53 (1958).      Comment      The contributory negligence of the plaintiff-employee goes only to a proportionate diminution in   the amount of damages and does not bar a recovery for an injury that resulted in part from the defendant’s   negligence. Albertson v. Chicago M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 242 Minn. 50, 64 N.W.2d 175 (1954). Contributory   negligence is not a defense on the issue of liability, but may be evaluated on the issue as to the amount of   damages on a comparative negligence basis. Cordova v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., 198   Cal. App. 2d 161, 18 Cal. Rptr. 144 (1961).     For Kansas authority see Merando v. Atchison, T. & S. F R. Co., 232 Kan. 404, 407, 656 P.2d 154   (1982).     The FELA does not provide for reduction of the amount of damages payable by a liable employer   through apportionment of damages between railroad and non-railroad causes. Norfolk & Western R. Co. v.   Ayers, 583 U.S. 135, 123 S. Ct. 1210, 155 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2003). There, the trial court properly instructed   the jury “not to make a deduction for the contribution of non-railroad exposures” to asbestos, as long as it   found defendant was negligent and that “dust exposures at [Norfolk] contributed, however slightly, to the   plaintiff’s injuries.”                              "      <h4><a name='132.32' href='132.32'>132.32</a></h4><p>FELA WRONGFUL DEATH—MEASURE OF DAMAGES      If you find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, you must then consider   the amount of recovery that will fairly and justly compensate the survivors of   the decedent for all pecuniary losses they have suffered and for all pecuniary   losses they are reasonably certain to suffer in the future by reason of the death   of the decedent, reducing all such future pecuniary losses to their present cash   value.      Notes on Use      See PIK 4"  for an instruction on mortality tables. See PIK 4" , FELA—Wrongful   Death—Determination of Pecuniary Loss, for factors to consider in determining pecuniary loss. When   contributory negligence is an issue, PIK 4" , Diminution of Damages Because of Contributory   Negligence, must also be given.      Comment      FELA is exclusive on the question of damages and places no restriction on the amount, and therefore   no limitation applies except that of the damages actually sustained. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Devine,   239 U.S. 52, 36 S. Ct. 27, 60 L. Ed. 140 (1915). The state statute limiting the amount of recovery in death   cases has no force and should not be considered in cases under FELA. Dodd v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.   Co., 354 Mo. 1205, 193 S.W.2d 905 (1946).     Recovery for the death of a deceased employee is restricted to the pecuniary damages sustained by   his surviving dependents. Boller v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 185 F. Supp. 505 (N.D. Ind. 1960). Where future   payments or other future benefits are to be anticipated, the verdict should be on the basis of present value   only. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. McKinley, 288 F.2d 262 (6th Cir. 1961). In a Federal Employers’ Liability Act   action, the employer is entitled to have the jury instructed that an award for future economic loss must be   on the basis of its present value. Koser v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 261 Kan. 46, 928 P.2d 85   (1996).     Because FELA actions are governed by federal law, the division of damages among the survivors   is not affected by state law. Re Barker 5 Estate, 134 Misc. 833, 237 N.Y.S. 212 (1929). The jury award   should be in a lump sum to conform to 36 Stat. 291 (1910), 45 U.S.C. 59 (1958), which provides for “only   one recovery.” However, the problem of allocating the award among the beneficiaries is not covered by the   statute and the decisions are not harmonious. It has been held proper for a jury to apportion damages among   the beneficiaries where the state practice so provides. The court has a right to submit interrogatories asking   what was found to be the pecuniary loss of each dependent. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., Inc., 113 Vt. 433,   35 A.2d 365 (1943). It has been stated that because the statute is silent on the question of apportionment it   has generally been interpreted as not requiring juries to make an apportionment. To do so would in many   cases double the issues and make a jury investigate the domestic affairs of a deceased—a matter more   properly for a court.     Apportionment has been held to be ancillary or collateral to the main issue and, hence, within the   jurisdiction of the court in which the action was pending. Stark v. Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee Ry.   Co., 203 F.2d 786 (7th Cir. 1953).      2008      "      2008      It has been held in Kansas that a division of funds derived from an out-of-court settlement is to be   distributed as personal property according to the laws of intestate succession when an administrator enters   into such a settlement with a railroad for the alleged wrongful death of one of its employees and executes   a general release not specifying under what statute the settlement is made. Holmes v. Price, 186 Kan. 623,   352 P.2d 5 (1960). Although the claim in the Holmes case had been made under three Kansas acts and under   the FELA, the trial court had found that there had been no evidence the settlement had been made under the   federal act.     In view of the Kansas statute requiring apportionment by the court in proportion to the loss sustained   by each of the heirs (K.S.A. 60-1905), it would seem that the preferable practice would be to permit the   jury to return a verdict for the total damages and to require the trial judge to apportion the verdict among   the beneficiaries shown to be entitled to participate in the recovery.

An instruction on damages in a death case under the FELA that told the jury to determine the   pecuniary loss sustained by the widow and children by reason of the death of the decedent was approved   by the Kansas Supreme Court. The jury was informed that in determining such sum it could consider the   age of the decedent; his earning capacity; his disposition to contribute, to care for, and to furnish money   to his wife; the ages of the children and the probable expectation of life of the parties.

Funeral expenses are not allowable as part of the damages recoverable by the widow under the FELA   for the death of her husband. However, permitting recovery for funeral expenses is not reversible error   when no exception was urged. Thompson v. Jason, 265 S.W.2d 920 (Tex. Civ. App. 1954).

These   injuries and losses may include any of the following shown by the evidence:      1. MEDICAL EXPENSES. Medical expenses include the   reasonable expenses of necessary medical care, hospitalization   and treatment received as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date   (and the medical expenses plaintiff is reasonably expected to   incur in the future) [reduced to present value].     2. ECONOMIC LOSS. Economic loss includes loss of time   or income and losses other than medical expenses incurred as   a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date (and the economic loss   plaintiff is reasonably expected to incur in the future) [reduced   to present value].     3. NONECONOMIC LOSS. Noneconomic loss includes   pain, suffering, disabilities, disfigurement and any accompanying   mental anguish suffered as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date   (and the noneconomic loss plaintiff is reasonably expected to   suffer in the future) [reduced to present value].      [The reasonable value of any medical care, hospitalization, or treatment   incurred by the plaintiff is a question for the jury to determine. Evidence   relevant to determining the reasonable value of an injured plaintiff’s medical   expenses may include the amount actually billed by the health care provider.   The evidence also may include write-offs or other acknowledgments that   something less than the amount charged has satisfied, or will satisfy, the   amount billed. Accordingly, neither the amount billed nor the amount actually   accepted after a write-off conclusively establishes the reasonable value of   medical services.]|      When determining the amount of plaintiff’s damages you must consider   plaintiff’s age, condition of health before and after the occurrence in question,   and the nature, extent and duration of the plaintiff’s injuries.      If you find plaintiff suffered an injury or injuries and more than minimal   discomfort as a result of the occurrence, then you must compensate the plaintiff   for plaintiff’s pain and suffering. There is no unit value and no mathematical   formula the court can give you for determining items such as pain, suffering,   disability, and mental anguish. You must establish an amount that will fairly   and adequately compensate the plaintiff. This amount rests within your sound   discretion.      You must itemize the amounts of damages awarded in this case on the   verdict form.      2016      "       Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 60-249a. This instruction combines the two separate instructions which   originally appeared as  and .      The trial court should instruct the jury only on those items of damage upon which there is some   evidence to base an award. The parenthetical language should be included when there is evidence of   future damages. The bracketed language should be used only when evidence of present value has been   introduced.      In Martinez v. Milburn Enterprises, Inc., 290 Kan 572, 233 P.3d 205 (2010), the court held that the   collateral source rule did not bar evidence of the amount originally billed by the health care provider for   plaintiff’s medical treatment or the reduced amount accepted by the provider in full satisfaction of the   amount billed. Evidence of the amount billed and the reduced amount accepted are relevant to prove the   reasonable value of medical treatment. If such evidence is admitted, the bracketed paragraph regarding the   reasonable value of medical treatment should be used. In addition, a limiting instruction must be given.   See PIK 4" , Limited Admissibility of Evidence as to One Party or Purpose.     In Stowers v. Rimel, 19 Kan. App. 2d 723, 875 P.2d 1002 (1994), the jury returned a verdict limited   to the plaintiff's medical expenses. Because the evidence was uncontradicted that plaintiff had experienced   pain and suffering, the trial court instructed the jury to resume its deliberations to consider that element   of damage. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s order that the jury resume its   deliberations.     Under circumstances like those presented in Stowers, the following instruction could be used:     In view of your verdict awarding medical expenses, the law requires that you award   some amount for pain and suffering. You should resume your deliberations to determine   that amount. The amount of damages rests within your sound discretion.      This pattern instruction must be revised or modified if the underlying theory to support recovery is   based upon diminution or deprivation of chance to survive. See Boody v. U.S., 706 F. Supp. 1458 (D. Kan.   1989), and Donnini v. Ouano, 15 Kan. App. 2d 517, 810 P.2d 1163 (1991). See also PIK 4" , Verdict   Form—Loss of Chance Issue—Survival, and PIK 4" , Loss of Chance—Survival—Causation.      Comment      In a personal injury action, the incidence of federal or state income taxation is not a proper factor to   be considered by the jury in making an award of damages. Rediker v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Rld.   Co., | Kan. App. 2d 581, 590, 571 P.2d 70 (1977); Spencer v. Eby Construction Co., 186 Kan. 345, 350,   350 P.2d 18 (1960).     In an action for personal injuries, the trial court should instruct the jury only on those items of   damage upon which there is some evidence to base an award. It is not proper to give a general instruction   on damages for “any of the following shown by the evidence,” when there is no evidence to support an   award for a particular item. Wahwasuck v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 250 Kan. 606, 828 P.2d 923 (1992);   Garrison v. Marlatt, 224 Kan. 390, 580 P.2d 885 (1978).      A defendant in any action is allowed to have amounts allowed for future damages reduced to present   worth where there are reasonable grounds to expect that the amount awarded may be safely and profitably   invested. Evidence demonstrating how to compute present worth, either by way of expert testimony or   appropriate mathematical tables or formulae, is admissible in any action in which substantial future damages   are claimed. Gannaway v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Rld. Co., 2 Kan. App. 2d 81, 575 P.2d 566 (1978).     Disfigurement has been defined as that which impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry or appearance   of a person or thing, that which renders unsightly, misshapen or imperfect, or deforms in some manner. Smith   v. Marshall, 225 Kan. 70, 587 P.2d 320 (1978). Evidence of a locking elbow which occurred frequently and   without warning meets the definition of disfigurement. Ratterree v. Bartlett, 238 Kan. 11, 21, 707 P.2d 1063   (1985), citing with approval this instruction.      2016                 Impairment of an injured party’s capacity to earn is relevant in calculating that party’s loss of income.   The amount of damages to be awarded is determined by “comparing what the injured party was capable of   earning at or before the time of the injury with what the party is capable of earning after the injury.” The   injured party’s health and physical ability before and after the injury should also be considered. Morris   v. Francisco, 238 Kan. 71, 79, 708 P.2d 498 (1985). See also Cerretti v. Flint Hills Rural Electric Co-op   Ass'n, 251 Kan. 347, 837 P.2d 330 (1992).      Loss of enjoyment of life is not a separate category of nonpecuniary damages in a personal injury   action and it is error to submit a separate instruction, or provide a separate verdict form entry, on loss of   enjoyment of life. However, in a proper case loss of enjoyment of life is a valid subcomponent or element   of pain and suffering and/or disability. Leiker v. Gafford, 245 Kan. 325, 778 P.2d 823 (1989).     Under the rationale of Leiker, the trial court properly allowed plaintiff to argue loss of enjoyment of   life and instructed the jury that such a loss is an element of disability, pain, and suffering. Gregory v. Carey,   246 Kan. 504, 514, 791 P.2d 1329 (1990).     The jury is required to itemize the amount awarded for noneconomic damages. In Hilburn v.   Enerpipe Ltd., 309 Kan. 1127, 442 P.3d 509 (2019), the limitation in K.S.A. 60-19a02 of a maximum   allowable recovery for noneconomic loss was held to be unconstitutional. The court held that the limitation   violated a plaintiff’s inviolate right to a trial by jury because it intruded upon the jury’s determination of   the compensation owed to redress an injury.     Anxiety based upon a reasonable fear that an existing injury will lead to the occurrence of a disease   or condition in the future is an element of recovery. For the fear to be reasonable, it is not necessary to   show that the prospect of such an occurrence is a medical certainty or probability. It is sufficient if there is a   showing that a substantial possibility exists for such an occurrence. Zamplin v. Star Lumber & Supply Co.,   251 Kan. 300, 308, 836 P.2d 1102 (1992).      A disability may be a noneconomic loss or an economic loss. If damages are awarded for pain and   suffering based upon a disability, the disability is a noneconomic loss subject to a damages cap. If the   damages award is for diminished earning capacity based on that disability, the loss is economic and not   subject to a damages cap. Extent of diminished earning capacity is arrived at by comparing what the injured   party was capable of earning at or before time of injury with what party is capable of earning after injury.   Cott v. Peppermint Twist Mgt. Co., 253 Kan. 452, 471, 856 P.2d 906 (1993).     Economic damages include the cost of medical care, past and future, and related benefits, i.e., lost   wages, loss of earning capacity, and other such losses. Noneconomic losses include claims for pain and   suffering, mental anguish, injury, disfigurement not affecting earning capacity, and losses which cannot be   easily expressed in dollars and cents. McKissick v. Frye, 255 Kan. 566, 588, 876 P.2d 1371 (1994).     In Shirley v. Smith, 261 Kan. 685, 933 P.2d 651 (1997), a medical malpractice case arising from an   unsuccessful bone marrow operation, the court allowed the plaintiff to claim economic damages for loss of   time spent by the plaintiff in self-catheterization. The court determined that loss of time was compensable   as measured by the amount an employer would have paid plaintiff for the time spent on the procedure. The   amount awarded was not subject to the cap for noneconomic damages.     In Wilson v. Williams, 261 Kan. 703, 710, 933 P.2d 757 (1997), the court allowed a per diem or   mathematical formula argument by counsel in order for a jury to place value on pain and suffering. This   decision overruled Caylor v. Atchison, T. & S. F Rly. Co., 190 Kan. 261, 374 P.2d 53 (1962). Even though   counsel is now allowed to argue a mathematical formula for the jury to compute pain and suffering, the trial   court should not provide a mathematical formula to the jury.

Notes on Use      The development of the “one-action” rule in comparative negligence litigation required revision of   the instruction and limits the circumstances under which it should be used.      Comment      Before the advent of comparative fault, a negligent party could be held liable for original injuries   aggravated by subsequent medical treatment irrespective of whether that treatment was done in a proper   manner. Fieser v. St. Francis Hospital & School of Nursing, Inc., 212 Kan. 35, 510 P.2d 145 (1973), and   Keown v. Young, 129 Kan. 563, 283 P. 511 (1930).      Under comparative fault, all parties to an occurrence must have their fault determined in one action.   Brown v. Keill, 224 Kan. 195, 207, 580 P.2d 867 (1978).     In Teepak, Inc. v. Learned, 237 Kan. 320, 699 P.2d 35 (1985), the Supreme Court applied the   one-action rule to successive tortfeasors. Consequently it was necessary to limit this instruction to those   situations wherein the additional harm was done in a non-negligent manner.

In arriving at the amount of recovery, you should consider the loss or   impairment of plaintiff's ability to perform services in the household and   in the discharge of (his) (her) domestic duties, and the loss or impairment of   plaintiff's companionship, aid, assistance, comfort and society.

In Thatcher, the court held that damages   to a utility pole should not be reduced by a depreciation factor, because the pole had no market value and   no discernible life expectancy and the utility company had no systematic program for replacing its poles.

Under the   facts of the case, the court determined that a 13-year-old pet dog had no discernable market value. The   court held that when an injured pet dog with no discernable market value is restored to its previous health,   the measure of damages may include, but is not limited to, the reasonable and customary cost of necessary   veterinary care and treatment.      2016                   "      <h4><a name='171.20' href='171.20'>171.20</a></h4><p>REAL ESTATE—PERMANENT DAMAGE      When damage to real estate is permanent or irreparable, the measure of   damages is the difference between the fair and reasonable market value of the   property as a whole, including the improvements thereon, immediately before   and immediately after the injury.

There are two types of damages you may award: economic and   noneconomic.      Economic damages include:      1. Loss of marital care, attention, advice, counsel, or protection.   2. Loss of earnings you find the deceased would have provided.   3. Expenses for the care of the deceased caused by the injury.   4. Reasonable funeral expenses.      For items 1 and 2 above you should allow an amount that   you believe would be equivalent to the benefit plaintiff could   reasonably have expected to receive from the continued life of   the deceased.      Noneconomic damages include:      1. Mental anguish, suffering, or bereavement.   2. Loss of society, loss of comfort, or loss of companionship.      For noneconomic damages there is no unit value and no   mathematical formula the court can give you. You should allow   an amount that you find to be fair and just under all the facts   and circumstances.      You will be given a verdict form in which you must itemize the amount of   damages awarded for losses to date and the amount of damages awarded for   future losses.      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 60-1903 and K.S.A. 60-1904. This instruction has been modified so that the   elements of damage included in the instruction conform with the elements of damage included in K.S.A.   60-1904.     The court should instruct the jury only on those items of damages for which there is some evidence   to base an award. However, it is important to note that the elements of damage included in K.S.A. 60-1904   are nonexclusive. If the trial court finds that the evidence supports additional elements of damage not       2008      "      2020      included in the statute, the court should include the additional elements of damage in the instruction to the   jury.     Although the statute uses the terms “pecuniary loss” and “nonpecuniary loss,” the Committee has   used the terms “economic loss” and “noneconomic loss” in order to be consistent with PIK 4"    and because these terms are better understood by the jury. There is no meaningful distinction between   pecuniary loss and economic loss.     The jury is required to separately state the amount of damages allowed for economic and noneconomic   loss. A verdict form that separates these two types of damages should be submitted to the jury. K.S.A. 60-   1903 limits noneconomic damages in wrongful death litigation to $250,000 and provides the jury is not to   be informed of the limitation.     K.S.A. 60-1903 was found to be constitutional in Leiker v. Gafford, 245 Kan. 325, 778 P.2d 823   (1989). The Hilburn decision, holding the statutory limit on noneconomic damages in personal injury   cases to be unconstitutional, did not address the statutory limit on noneconomic damages in wrongful death   actions.

Comment      Nonpecuniary damages generally are intangible in nature such as mental anguish, bereavement,   loss of society and loss of companionship. Pecuniary damages are “such as can be estimated in and   compensated by money.” If the jury verdict, after any adjustment for comparative fault, results in an award   of nonpecuniary damages in excess of the statutory limit, the court must enter judgment for nonpecuniary   damages in the amount of the statutory limit.

For items 1 and 2 above you should allow an amount that   you believe would be equivalent to the benefit plaintiff could   reasonably have expected to receive from the continued life of   the deceased.      Noneconomic damages include:      1. Mental anguish, suffering, or bereavement.   2. Loss of society, loss of comfort, or loss of companionship.      For noneconomic damages there is no unit value and no   mathematical formula the court can give you. You should allow   an amount that you find to be fair and just under all the facts   and circumstances.      You will be given a verdict form in which you must itemize the amount of   damages awarded for losses to date and the amount of damages awarded for   future losses.      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 60-1903 and K.S.A. 60-1904. This instruction has been modified so that the   elements of damage included in the instruction conform with the elements of damage included in K.S.A.   60-1904.     The court should instruct the jury only on those items of damages for which there is some evidence   to base an award. However, it is important to note that the elements of damage included in K.S.A. 60-1904   are nonexclusive. If the trial court finds that the evidence supports additional elements of damage not   included in the statute, the court should include the additional elements of damage in the instruction to the      jury.      2008      "      2020      Although the statute uses the terms “pecuniary loss” and “nonpecuniary loss,” the Committee has   used the terms “economic loss” and “noneconomic loss” in order to be consistent with PIK 4"    and because these terms are better understood by the jury. There is no meaningful distinction between   pecuniary loss and economic loss.     The jury is required to separately state the amount of damages allowed for economic and noneconomic   loss. A verdict form that separates these two types of damages should be submitted to the jury. K.S.A. 60-   1903 limits noneconomic damages in wrongful death litigation to $250,000 and provides the jury is not to   be informed of the limitation.     K.S.A. 60-1903 was found to be constitutional in Leiker v. Gafford, 245 Kan. 325, 778 P.2d 823   (1989). The Hilburn decision, holding the statutory limit on noneconomic damages in personal injury   cases to be unconstitutional, did not address the statutory limit on noneconomic damages in wrongful death   actions. Hilburn v. Enerpipe Ltd., 309 Kan. 1127, 442 P.3d 509 (2019).     If an action is brought by, or on behalf of, more than one heir, the following may be added to the   instruction:      “The court will determine how any amount you allow will be divided among the heirs.”      A separate survival action may be justified for some deaths. K.S.A. 60-1801. When an action for   wrongful death is joined with an action brought by the personal representative of the deceased for damages   sustained during the deceased’s lifetime, appropriate parts of PIK 4"  as well as this instruction   should be given.      Comment      Nonpecuniary damages generally are intangible in nature such as mental anguish, bereavement,   loss of society and loss of companionship. Pecuniary damages are “such as can be estimated in and   compensated by money.” If the jury verdict, after any adjustment for comparative fault, results in an award   of nonpecuniary damages in excess of the statutory limit, the court must enter judgment for nonpecuniary   damages in the amount of the statutory limit. McCart v. Muir, 230 Kan. 618, 641 P.2d 384 (1982).      When an action for wrongful death is joined with a survival action for damages sustained during the   deceased’s lifetime, the failure to instruct on both types of damages is clearly erroneous. Putter v. Bowman,   7 Kan. App. 2d 323, 326, 641 P.2d 411 (1982).     When a plaintiff has shown an actual loss of services, attention, care, advice, protection, and   educational, physical, and moral training and guidance, and the extent thereof, a jury is not precluded from   considering such items in determining pecuniary damages even though no actual dollar evidence of value   was presented. Such services are valuable per se and pecuniary in nature. Wentling v. Medical Anesthesia   Services, 237 Kan. 503, 701 P.2d 939 (1985).      In Wilson v. Williams, 261 Kan. 703, 710, 933 P.2d 757 (1997), the court allowed a per diem or   mathematical formula argument by counsel in order for a jury to place value on pain and suffering. This   decision overruled Caylor v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Rly. Co., 190 Kan. 261, 374 P.2d 53 (1962). Even though   counsel is now allowed to argue a mathematical formula for the jury to compute pain and suffering, the trial   court should not provide a mathematical formula to the jury.      In Howell v. Calvert, 268 Kan. 698, 1 P.3d 310 (2000), an action for the wrongful death of a child, the   trial court rejected the plaintiff’s request to instruct the jury that pecuniary damages included loss of care   and nurturing, loss of aid and assistance, loss of counsel and advice, loss of continued family relationship,   and loss of enjoyment and entertainment. On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s   decision and determined that the requested instruction went beyond the traditional definition of pecuniary   loss for the wrongful death of a child.     A settlement with a defendant who might be held liable for a proportional share of the damages for a      wrongful death does not diminish the plaintiff’s right to recover judgment up to the statutory limit. Adams   v. Via Christi Regional Medical Center, 270 Kan. 824, Syl. 1 4, 19 P.3d 132 (2001).

Comment      For authority, see Foster v. Humburg, 180 Kan. 64, 68, 299 P.2d 46 (1956), and Billups v. American   Surety Co., 173 Kan. 646, 649, 251 P.2d 237 (1952).     There may be occasions when this short form will suffice. On other occasions more specific   instructions as to measure of damages may be used. This instruction was cited with approval in EF Hutton   & Co. v. Heim, 236 Kan. 603, 615, 694 P.2d 445 (1985).     All measures of damages should produce the same result, but the one that most appropriately fits the   circumstances of the case should be used.     “Damages for personal injuries cannot be definitely assessed by any single method of measurement   or by any scientifically accurate combination of methods known to the legal profession, but all known   methods which are helpful in determining actual loss or damage should be employed in aid of the judicial   process, or effort, designed to render a reasonably just award.” Young v. Kansas City Public Service Co.,   156 Kan. 624, 135 P.2d 551 (1943).

If you award the plaintiff   actual damages, then you may consider whether punitive damages should be   allowed. Punitive damages may be allowed in the jury’s discretion to punish   a defendant and to deter others from like conduct.      The plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the   defendant acted in a (willful) (wanton) (fraudulent) (malicious) manner toward   plaintiff. Evidence is clear and convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact   asserted is highly probable.      If you find the defendant did one or more of the acts claimed by the   plaintiff you should then determine whether the plaintiff has presented clear   and convincing evidence that the defendant acted in a (willful) (wanton)   (fraudulent) (malicious) manner toward plaintiff. If you determine punitive   damages should be allowed, your finding must be entered in the verdict form.   After the trial, the court will conduct a separate hearing to determine the   amount of punitive damages to be allowed.

K.S.A. 60-3701 et seq. provides in any civil action the jury will no longer fix the amount of punitive   damages. If the jury determines punitive damages are recoverable, then the court will decide the amount to   be awarded. This procedure was held to be constitutional in Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 866 P.2d 985   (1993).      Comment      PIK 3d  [now PIK 4" ] was cited with approval in York v. InTrust Bank, N.A., 265 Kan.   271, 307, 962 P.2d 405 (1998).

The nature and enormity of the wrong together with mitigating circumstances should be considered   in assessing punitive damages. Henderson v.

"      2010      "       Generally, damages for breach of contract are limited to pecuniary losses sustained, and exemplary   or punitive damages are not recoverable, in absence of an independent tort or wrong causing additional   injury. Mabery v. Western Casualty and Surety Co., 173 Kan. 586, 250 P.2d 824 (1952).     For what constitutes wantonness such as will justify an instruction on punitive damages see Cerretti   v.

Punitive damages as well as actual damages may be recovered where a breach of a fiduciary duty is   involved. Newton v. Hornblower, Inc., 224 Kan. 506, 524, 582 P.2d 1136 (1978).     Actual damages recovered, the defendant’s financial condition and the probable litigation expenses,   may be considered in fixing an award of punitive damages. See Henderson v. Hassur, 225 Kan. 678, 694,   594 P.2d 650 (1979); Sanders v. Park Towne, Ltd., 2 Kan. App. 2d 313, 319, 578 P.2d 1131 (1978); and   Ayers v. Christiansen, 222 Kan. 225, 229, 564 P.2d 458 (1977).     The trial court erred in instructing the jury to consider the defendant’s financial condition in awarding   punitive damages absent any evidence as to that item. Folks v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 243 Kan. 57, 755   P.2d 1319 (1988).     Punitive damages are not an automatic, mandatory result even when recklessness is shown, but are   awarded in the discretion of the trial court. Garcia v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 216 Kan. 591, 533 P.2d   1242 (1975); Nordstrom v. Miller, 227 Kan. 59, 70, 605 P.2d 545 (1980).     The bifurcated proceeding now required does not render prior case law obsolete. The authorities   cited are still useful in determining under what circumstances a jury will be permitted to consider an   allowance for punitive damages and the amount to be awarded by the trial judge.      In State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 1526, 155 L.   Ed. 2d 585 (2003), the Court held that a jury’s punitive damage award of $145 million for an automobile   liability insurer’s bad-faith failure to settle for the insured’s policy limits, where the compensatory damages   were $1 million, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed and, therefore, violated   the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.     Due process is not violated when a jury is allowed to consider harm to non-parties, as evidence   that defendant’s conduct was reprehensible, when the jury is determining whether punitive damages are   appropriate. However, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 127 S. Ct, 1057, 166 L. Ed. 2d   940 (2007), holds that an award of punitive damages may not include any amount to punish wrongful or   unlawful conduct toward non-parties.      2010       "       2020      <h4><a name='171.45' href='171.45'>171.45</a></h4><p>MORTALITY TABLE—LIFE EXPECTANCY      According to life expectancy tables, a person of plaintiff’s age has a   remaining life expectancy of years.

You may award the amount of lost profits proved with   reasonable certainty.      Comment      In Vickers v. Wichita State University, 213 Kan. 614, 620, 518 P.2d 512 (1974), the court held:   “Unquestionably, a method of establishing a loss of profits with reasonable certainty is by showing a history   of past profitability. Past profitability of a particular business is not, however, the only method of proving   lost future profits. The evidence necessary in establishing lost future profits with reasonable certainty ‘must   depend in a large measure upon the circumstances of the particular case.’” The court recognized that   recovery of lost profits is not precluded merely because a business is newly-established or has not made a   profit during the start-up phase of the business. “Absolute certainty in proving loss of future profits is not   required. [citation omitted] What is required is that the court or jury be guided by some rational standard.”   id.     See also Butler v. Westgate State Bank, 226 Kan. 581, Syl.

Date      District Judge      Notes on Use      K.S.A. 60-248(a) provides that a jury shall consist of twelve persons, unless the parties stipulate to   any number less than twelve.      If the jury consists of twelve members, the agreement of ten jurors is sufficient to render a verdict. If   the jury consists of fewer than twelve members, the verdict must be unanimous (unless the parties stipulate   to a verdict by fewer than all jurors). K.S.A. 60-248(g); Cott v. Peppermint Twist Mgt. Co., 253 Kan. 452,   0, 856 P.2d 906 (1993).     Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-248(g), the completed verdict should be read to the jury and inquiry made   whether it is the jury’s verdict. Ifa party asks that the jurors be polled individually, the clerk or judge should   call each juror’s name and ask him or her to answer the following question “Yes” or “No.”      “Do you agree that the verdict read by the (clerk) (judge) was the verdict of the jury   by agreement of at least (10) members of the jury?”      The statute does not require that any dissenting jurors be individually identified.

In this case your verdict will be returned in the form of written answers to   special written questions submitted by the court. Your answers will constitute   your verdict.      [Your answer to each question must be by the agreement of ten or more   jurors] [Your answers to the questions must be unanimous].      Your verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and   the law as given in these instructions.      Date      District Judge      Notes on Use      See Notes on Use under PIK 4"  for a discussion of when the verdict must be unanimous.     This instruction is to be used when a special verdict or a verdict with interrogatories is submitted, as   permitted by K.S.A. 60-249. A special verdict must be given in comparative fault cases (K.S.A. 60-258a),   personal injury cases (K.S.A. 60-249a), wrongful death cases (K.S.A. 60-1901 et seg.), and any case where   an award for pain and suffering is requested (K.S.A. 60-19a02 et seq.).     Even when special verdicts are not required by statute, the Committee recommends giving verdicts   with special questions in most cases, as special questions can lay a path for jurors to follow in their   deliberations. Further, giving a verdict with special questions can simplify the trial court’s task of giving   instructions in a complex case. This practice was approved by the Supreme Court in Anderson v. Heartland   Oil & Gas, Inc., 249 Kan. 458, 2, 819 P.2d 1192 (1991).      Comment      “The decision whether to submit a special verdict form or instruct the jury on the law and how it   applies in that particular case is within the sound discretion of the trial court.” Trendel v. Rogers, 24 Kan.   App. 2d 938, 955 P.2d 150 (1998).                            The decision to submit special interrogatories or questions is discretionary with the trial court.   Anderson v. Heartland Oil & Gas, Inc., 249 Kan. 458, 471, 819 P.2d 1192 (1991).     A trial court’s refusal to submit helpful, but not essential, questions to the jury is not grounds for   reversal. English Village Properties, Inc. v. Boettcher & Lieurance Constr. Co., 7 Kan. App. 2d 307, 317,   640 P.2d 1282 (1982).     Kansas follows the “Any Majority Rule” in holding that agreement by the requisite number of jurors   on any questions before the jury is sufficient to constitute a verdict. The same coalition of ten need not   agree on every question before the jury in order to render a valid verdict. Hendrix v. Docusort, Inc., 18 Kan.   App. 2d 806, 813, 860 P.2d 62 (1993).     If the requisite number of jurors agree on the finding of fault, it does not matter that they do not   agree on the specific acts of negligence when two or more acts of negligence are alleged by the plaintiff   and instructed upon by the court. Cleveland v. Wong, 237 Kan. 410, 418, 701 P.2d 1301 (1985).      A jury’s findings on issues submitted by special verdicts must be certain and definite and must not   be conflicting or inconsistent. Donnini v. Quano, 15 Kan. App. 2d 517, 525, 810 P.2d 1163 (1991). See also   Rohr v. Henderson, 207 Kan. 123, 130, 483 P.2d 1089 (1971).      When a jury’s answers to questions on a special verdict are so patently inconsistent as not to warrant   entry of judgment, a new trial should be granted. Reed v. Chaffin, 205 Kan. 815, , 473 P.2d 102   (1970).     Errors in the form of a verdict may be corrected pursuant to K.S.A. 60-248(g) prior to the discharge   of the jury and with its consent. Amendment, correction, or reformation of a verdict are distinguished from   impeachment under K.S.A. 60-441. Traylor v. Wachter, 3 Kan.

K.S.A. 60-258a.     All parties and any others whose causal negligence or fault must be determined under K.S.A. 60-   258a must be listed in question 2.     In question 3 insert the name of the party claiming damages. If two or more parties are claiming   damages duplicate question 3 for each party claiming damages.     List only those items of damages under question 3 for which evidence was introduced at trial. K.S.A.   60-249a.      K.S.A. 60-249a, 60-19a01 et seq., and 60-1903 require itemization of damages in personal injury and   wrongful death litigation. The language of the statutes suggests the use of “noneconomic” and “economic”   phraseology in personal injury and medical malpractice verdict forms and “pecuniary” and “nonpecuniary”   in wrongful death verdict forms. However, the Committee recommends the use of the terms “economic”   and “noneconomic” in all three types of cases, as there appears to be no meaningful distinction between   “economic” and “pecuniary.” Additionally “economic” is more readily understandable to lay jurors than   “pecuniary.”     K.S.A. 60-19a02 limits the maximum allowable recovery for noneconomic loss to $250,000 in an   action for personal injuries accruing before July 1, 2014, to $300,000 in an action accruing between July   1, 2014 and June 30, 2018, to $325,000 in an action accruing between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2022, and   to $350,000 in an action accruing after July 1, 2022. K.S.A. 60-1903 limits recovery in a wrongful death   action also to $250,000. Both statutes require that the jury not be instructed on the limitations.     K.S.A. 60-3407 and 60-3408 require the jury in medical malpractice cases to specify the period of   time over which future economic losses will be experienced. However, in Kansas Malpractice Victims   Coalition v. Bell, 243 Kan. 333, 757 P.2d 251 (1988), the Supreme Court held that those portions of Article   34 (Professional Liability Actions) that capped medical malpractice awards were unconstitutional. In   addition the court held unconstitutional the requirement that the trial court enter judgment for the cost of   an annuity contract which would pay benefits for the period of time over which future economic losses   would be experienced by the plaintiff. After Malpractice Victims was handed down, the legislature repealed   K.S.A. 60-3409 and 60-3411, which provided for the caps, and K.S.A. 60-3407 expired in accordance   with its sunset provision on July 1, 1993. The legislature did not, however, repeal K.S.A. 60-3408. The   Committee believes that the legislature’s failure to repeal this section was an oversight. The Committee   recommends that no question be submitted regarding the duration of future economic losses, as the question   is unnecessary in light of the court’s ruling striking down the annuity portions of the article.     After the jury returns its verdict, K.S.A. 60-258 requires that a journal entry of judgment be filed.   The jury’s verdict is not an effective judgment until the journal entry is filed, and interest does not begin to   run on unliquidated damages until the journal entry is filed. McGinnes v. Wesley Medical Center, 43 Kan.   App. 2d 227, 224 P.3d 581 (2010).      Comment      The constitutionality of the $250,000 cap established by K.S.A. 60-19a01 and K.S.A. 60-19a02   was upheld in Samsel v. Wheeler Transport Services, Inc., 244 Kan. 726, 771 P.2d 71 (1989), and Miller v.   Johnson, 295 Kan. 636, 289 P.3d 1098 (2012). The constitutionality of the caps established by K.S.A. 60-   1903 was upheld in Leiker v. Gafford, 245 Kan. 325, 778 P.2d 823 (1989).     It has been held error for the jury to award nothing for pain and suffering where plaintiff has incurred      more than the threshold amount of medical expenses and where the uncontroverted evidence shows that   plaintiff suffered more than minimal discomfort. Miller v. Zep Mfg. Co., 249 Kan. 34, 47, 815 P.2d 506                             "      (1991); German v. Blatchford, 246 Kan. 532, 539, 792 P.2d 1059 (1990); Stowers v. Rimel, 19 Kan. App.   2d 723, 727, 875 P.2d 1002 (1994).     In Wisker v. Hart, 244 Kan. 36, 41, 766 P.2d 168 (1988), the court cited PIK 2d 20.03 (the prior   numbering of PIK 4" ) with approval in holding that it is permissible to instruct the jury that it need   not determine a plaintiff’s damages if the plaintiff is found to be 50% or more at fault.     In Leiker v. Gafford, supra, it was held that nothing in K.S.A. 60-249a purports to restrict the   categories of noneconomic damages to those listed in subsection (b)(1) of the statute. Nevertheless, the   court held, “[I]n Kansas, loss of enjoyment of life is not a separate category of nonpecuniary damages in a   personal injury action and ... it is error to submit a separate instruction, or provide a separate verdict form   entry, on loss of enjoyment of life. However, in a proper case it is a valid subcomponent or element of pain   and suffering and/or disability.” 245 Kan. at 340.     In Noon v. Smith, 16 Kan. App. 2d 818, 820, 829 P.2d 922 (1992), the trial court’s failure to instruct   in accordance with PIK 2d 20.03 [PIK 4" ] was held to be error.      2016      "       <h4><a name='181.05' href='181.05'>181.05</a></h4><p>VERDICT FORM—LOSS OF CHANCE ISSUE—SURVIVAL      We, the jury, present the following answers to the questions submitted by   the court:      1.

The trial judge should note this verdict form would need to be substantially modified if comparative   fault were alternately alleged under traditional “but for” causation. Additionally, the Committee can   envision circumstances when the fault of the injured party (or decedent) would have to be compared in a   pure loss of chance case. Either circumstance will require creativity to fashion an appropriate verdict form.   PIK 4" , Verdict Form—Comparative Fault, should be reviewed.      To calculate the damages, the Committee believes that courts should subtract the percentage of   chances under the care given, as found by the jury in question three, from the percentage of chances under   proper care, as found in question two, and multiply the total damages as found in question four by the   remainder.     K.S.A. 60-3407 and 60-3408 require the jury in medical malpractice cases to specify the period of   time over which future economic losses will be experienced. However, in Kansas Malpractice Victims   Coalition v. Bell, 243 Kan. 333, 757 P.2d 251 (1988), the Supreme Court held that those portions of Article   34 (Professional Liability Actions) that capped medical malpractice awards were unconstitutional. In   addition the court held unconstitutional the requirement that the trial court enter judgment for the cost of   an annuity contract which would pay benefits for the period of time over which future economic losses   would be experienced by the plaintiff. After Malpractice Victims was handed down, the legislature repealed   K.S.A. 60-3409 and 60-3411, which provided for the caps, and K.S.A. 60-3407 expired in accordance   with its sunset provision on July 1, 1993. The legislature did not, however, repeal K.S.A. 60-3408. The   Committee is of the opinion that the legislature’s failure to repeal this section was an oversight. The   Committee recommends that no question be submitted regarding the duration of future economic losses, as   the question is unnecessary in light of the court’s ruling striking down the annuity portions of the article.      Comment      The loss of chance theory is a partial abrogation of the rule that the plaintiff must prove causation. It   has been adopted as a matter of public policy to avoid “open season on critically ill or injured patients as   care providers would [otherwise] be free of liability for even the grossest malpractice if the patient had only   a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the disease or injury even with proper treatment.” Roberson v. Counselman,   235 Kan. 1006, 686 P.2d 149 (1984), modified by Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 873 P.2d 175 (1994).      Unlike comparative fault, the loss of chance theory is not an affirmative defense. It simply relieves   the plaintiff of a large part of the burden of proof on causation. And, unlike comparative fault, plaintiff can   recover when the health care provider’s percentage of responsibility is less than 50%. The reduction in   the chance for survival or for better recovery only needs to be “substantial.” What percentage constitutes   “substantial” has not yet been determined by the appellate courts.     The Supreme Court first recognized the loss of chance of survival as a valid cause of action in   Roberson v. Counselman, supra. The court acknowledged that the issue related wholly to causation. 235   Kan. at 1010. The court ruled that the case should be submitted to the jury where the evidence has established   that plaintiff had “an appreciable chance to survive if given proper treatment. In making the determination,   the finder of fact should take into account both the patient’s chances of survival if properly treated and the   extent to which the patient’s chances of survival have been reduced by the claimed negligence.” 235 Kan.   at 1020.     In Donnini v. Ouano, 15 Kan. App. 2d 517, 810 P.2d 1163, rev. denied 248 Kan. 994 (1991), the   Court of Appeals held that the “loss of chance” rule is an exception to the normal rule that the plaintiff   must prove causation, and held that a cause of action in which the patient had a greater than 50% chance of   survival does not fall under the loss of chance exception. 15 Kan. App. 2d at .      2012      "      2012      Donnini v. Ouano, supra, is also instructive as to the trial court’s drafting of a verdict form that   combined comparative fault and loss of chance issues.     Delaney v. Cade, 255 Kan. 199, 873 P.2d 175 (1994), is important for two reasons. First, it extends the   loss of chance theory to cover loss of chance for better recovery. 255 Kan. . Second, it disapproves   Roberson’s use of the term “appreciable chance” and substitutes instead “substantial chance.” The court   held, “We do not adopt the any loss of a chance approach nor do we attempt to draw a bright line rule on   the percentage of lost chance that would be sufficient for the case to be submitted to the jury.” 255 Kan. at   .     In Dickey v. Daughety, 21 Kan. App. 2d 655, 905 P.2d 697 (1995) aff'd 260 Kan. 12, 917 P.2d 889   (1996), the Court of Appeals held that the loss of chance percentage should be applied before applying the   cap on nonpecuniary damages.     In Pipe v. Hamilton, 274 Kan. 905, Syl. 1 4, 56 P.3d 823 (2002), the Supreme Court reversed the   trial court’s decision granting summary judgment to a physician who unsuccessfully treated a patient who   had only a 5% to 10% chance of survival if treated properly. The court cited with approval the definition of   “substantial chance for survival/better recovery” found in PIK 3d  and  [now PIK 4"    and ], and held, as a matter of law, that a 10% chance of survival is not “token or de minimis.” The   court ruled that the plaintiff s claim must be submitted to a jury.                  "      <h4><a name='181.06' href='181.06'>181.06</a></h4><p>VERDICT FORM—LOSS OF CHANCE ISSUE—   BETTER RECOVERY      We, the jury, present the following answers to the questions submitted by   the court:      1. Do you find was denied a substantial chance   for better recovery due to the fault of the defendant?      Yes No      [Proceed to question 2 and following questions only if you answered “yes”   to question 1.]      2.

What do you find, as a percentage of one hundred   (100), were ’s chances for better recovery under   the care actually given? %     4.

Yes No      Presiding Juror       2012      "      2012      Notes on Use      This verdict form should be used and appropriately modified when the action is based in part or   entirely upon diminution or deprivation of chance for better recovery.     The trial judge should note this verdict form would need to be substantially modified if comparative   fault were alternately alleged under traditional “but for” causation. Additionally, the Committee can   envision circumstances when the fault of the injured party (or decedent) would have to be compared in a   pure loss of chance case. Either circumstance will require creativity to fashion an appropriate verdict form.   PIK 4" , Verdict Form—Comparative Fault, should be reviewed.      To calculate the damages, the Committee believes that courts should subtract the percentage of   chances under the care given, as found by the jury in question three, from the percentage of chances under   proper care, as found in question two, and multiply the total damages as found in question four by the   remainder.     K.S.A. 60-3407 and 60-3408 require the jury in medical malpractice cases to specify the period of   time over which future economic losses will be experienced. However, in Kansas Malpractice Victims   Coalition v. Bell, 243 Kan. 333, 757 P.2d 251 (1988), the Supreme Court held that those portions of Article   34 (Professional Liability Actions) that capped medical malpractice awards were unconstitutional. In   addition the court held unconstitutional the requirement that the trial court enter judgment for the cost of   an annuity contract which would pay benefits for the period of time over which future economic losses   would be experienced by the plaintiff. After Malpractice Victims was handed down, the legislature repealed   K.S.A. 60-3409 and 60-3411, which provided for the caps, and K.S.A. 60-3407 expired in accordance   with its sunset provision on July 1, 1993. The legislature did not, however, repeal K.S.A. 60-3408. The   Committee is of the opinion that the legislature’s failure to repeal this section was an oversight. The   Committee recommends that no question be submitted regarding the duration of future economic losses, as   the question is unnecessary in light of the court’s ruling striking down the annuity portions of the article.

If you should fail to reach a decision, the case   is left open and undecided. There is no reason to believe that the case can   be tried again any better or more exhaustively than it has been. There is no   reason to believe that more evidence or clearer evidence would be produced   on behalf of either side.      Also, there is no reason to believe that the case would ever be submitted   to twelve people more intelligent or more impartial or more reasonable than   you. Any future jury must be selected in the same manner that you were.      These matters are mentioned now because some of them may not have   been in your thoughts.      This does not mean that those favoring any particular position should   surrender their honest convictions as to the weight or effect of any evidence   solely because of the opinion of other jurors or because of the importance of   arriving at a decision.      This does mean that you should give respectful consideration to each   other’s views and talk over any differences of opinion in a spirit of fairness   and candor. If at all possible, you should resolve any differences and come to   a common conclusion so that this case may be completed.      [The giving of this instruction at this time in no way means it is more   important than any other instruction. On the contrary, you should consider   this instruction together with and as a part of the instructions which I   previously gave you.      You may now retire and continue your deliberations in such manner as   may be determined by your good judgment as reasonable people.|      Notes on Use      In prolonged trial, the court may wish to give the substance of this instruction along with the general   instructions at the close of the evidence in the case. As pointed out in the following comment, the Supreme   Court has criticized the giving of coercive instructions in criminal cases after jury deliberations have begun,   but suggests that the court does not risk error in giving the instruction before the jury retires. Therefore, the   Committee recommends if this instruction is given, it be given with the closing instructions before the jury   retires to deliberate. In that case the bracketed language should be omitted.     In Duncan v. West Wichita Family Physicians, P.A., 43 Kan. App. 2d 111, 221 P.3d 630 (2010), the   court found that the trial court committed error in giving the previous version of PIK , which included   as its third sentence, “This, like all cases, must be decided sometime.” The court strongly criticized the   trial court’s decision to give the instruction after the jury announced it was deadlocked. Though the court   found it was error to give the instruction, it held that the giving of the instruction, in and of itself, would       2012      "      2012      not be grounds for reversal. However, when considered in connection with evidence of juror misconduct   (i.e., an advance agreement to find liability only if a low damage verdict was agreed upon), the court found   reversible error.      Comment      The propriety of giving this instruction in criminal trials has been addressed on several occasions.   Although few verdicts have been reversed because of giving the instruction after the jury has announced   itself deadlocked, the court has been critical of the practice. In each case where the matter has been   considered, the court has noted that trial courts would be well advised to submit the instruction before the   jury retires to commence deliberations, not afterward. State v. Troy, 215 Kan. 369, 524 P.2d 1121 (1974);   State v. Boyd, 206 Kan. 597, 481 P.2d 1015, cert. denied 405 U.S. 927, 92 S. Ct. 977, 30 L. Ed. 2d 800   (1972); State v. Oswald, 197 Kan. 251, 417 P.2d 261 (1966).     In State v. Earsery, 199 Kan. 208, 428 P.2d 794 (1967), oral comments accompanying this instruction   were held to be coercive and prejudicial error. The giving of the instruction, coupled with the coercive oral   comments, was held to be reversible error.                              "      <h4><a name='181.30' href='181.30'>181.30</a></h4><p>QUOTIENT VERDICT      The Committee recommends that no instruction on quotient verdict be   given.      Comment      What constitutes quotient verdict is stated in Blevins v. Weingart Truck & Tractor Service, 186 Kan.   258, 263, 349 P.2d 896 (1960).     An agreement among jurors to find fault contingent upon a low damage verdict being entered was a   compromise verdict that required reversal. Duncan v. West Wichita Family Physicians, P.A., 43 Kan. App.   2d 111, 221 P.3d 630 (2010). The case contains a thorough discussion of compromise verdicts.     In Williams v. Lawton, 288 Kan. 768, 207 P.3d 1027 (2009), the Supreme Court held that an advance   agreement by jurors to be bound by the quotient of all juror’s individual verdicts is an impermissible   quotient verdict because it subverts the deliberative process by which jurors are to arrive at their decision.   Evidence of the existence of a quotient verdict is grounds for reversal.      2012      "       <h4><a name='181.40' href='181.40'>181.40</a></h4><p>POSTTRIAL COMMUNICATION WITH JURORS      Ladies and gentlemen, you have completed your duties as jurors in the   case and are discharged with the thanks of the Court. It is my duty to instruct   you that you have an absolute right to discuss or not discuss your deliberations   or verdict in this case with anyone.      Immediately after I have discharged you here today, the parties or their   lawyers or other representatives of the parties may discuss the case with you,   but only if you consent. Whether you discuss the case with anyone is entirely   your decision. If you choose to do so, you may share as much or as little as you   like about your deliberations or the facts that influenced your decision.      If the parties or their lawyers or other representatives of the parties   attempt to discuss this case with you at any later time, they must first inform   you of the identity of the case, their role in the case, and the subject of their   requested discussion. They also must inform you of your absolute right to   discuss or not discuss the case with them. If any sort of declaration has been   filed with the Court regarding the jury’s deliberations or verdict, the person   requesting the discussion with you must offer to provide you with a copy of   the declaration for your review.      You must promptly report to this Court if the parties or the lawyers or   other representatives of the parties make any unreasonable contact with you,   or if they attempt to discuss the case with you, without your consent. Such   contact or discussion may be a violation of this Court’s order.      This rule does not prevent me as the judge from discussing with you the   deliberations or verdict of the jury for any lawful purpose. This rule would   also not prevent a law enforcement officer from discussing with you the   deliberations or verdict of the jury if the officer is investigating an allegation   of criminal conduct.      Notes on Use      For authority, see K.S.A. 60-272.     Supreme Court Rule 181 governs posttrial calling of jurors and provides that jurors shall not be   called for hearing on posttrial motions without an order of the court after motion and hearing held to   determine whether all or any of the jurors should be called.

Members of the Jury: It is your duty to follow these instructions. These   instructions are the law in this case and they all must be considered and   applied to the evidence.      During the trial I have ruled upon objections to the admission of evidence.   You must not concern yourselves with the reasons for these rulings and you   must consider only the evidence which is admitted. I have not intended to   indicate any opinion as to what your verdict should be by any ruling that I   have made or anything that I have said or done.      Statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, but may help you   understand the evidence and apply the law. However, you should disregard   any comments of counsel that are not supported by the evidence.      Instruction No. 2.   Burden of proof means burden of persuasion.      A party that has the burden to prove a claim must persuade you that the   claim is more probably true than not true. In deciding whether this burden   has been met, you must consider all admitted evidence, whether presented by   the plaintiff or defendant.      Instruction No. 3.      It is for you to decide whether the testimony of each witness is believable   and what weight to give that testimony. In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Instruction No. 4.      Certain testimony has been given in this case by experts. Experts are   persons who, from experience, education or training have specialized   knowledge on matters not common to people in general. The law permits   experts to give their opinions about such matters. The testimony of experts   is to be considered like any other testimony and is to be evaluated by the   same tests. You should consider it in connection with all the other facts and   circumstances. You should give it the weight and credit you determine are   appropriate.      Instruction No. 5.      The plaintiff, Benton Fender, claims that he sustained injuries due to the   fault of the defendant, Betty Bender, in:      1. Failing to stop at a red light; and   2. Driving her automobile faster than the posted speed limit.                            "      The plaintiff has the burden to prove that it is more probably true than   not that he sustained injuries caused by any one or more of the claimed   negligent acts or omissions of the defendant. It is not necessary that each of   you agree upon a specific negligent act or omission.      The defendant denies that she was at fault, and denies that the plaintiff   was injured to the extent claimed.      The defendant claims that the plaintiff was at fault in:      1. Driving his automobile faster than the posted speed limit; and   2. Failing to keep a proper lookout for his own safety.      The defendant has the burden to prove that one or more of her claims   of fault on the part of the plaintiff are more probably true than not true.   Agreement as to which specific negligent act or omission is not required.      The plaintiff denies that he was at fault.      Instruction No. 6.      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. Reasonable care requires all   persons who use the streets and highways to obey the rules of the road. You   must decide from the evidence whether any of the following rules apply in this   case and whether any rules have been violated. The violation of any of these   rules is negligence.      Instruction No. 7      Adriver on a public highway must keep a proper lookout for other vehicles   and objects in his line of vision that may affect his use of the highway.      The driver is presumed to see those things a person would and could see   while exercising reasonable care under similar circumstances.      Instruction No. 8.      A driver must obey an official traffic control device, unless otherwise   directed by a traffic or police officer.      Instruction No. 9.      The driver of a vehicle approaching a steady red light must stop at a   clearly marked stop line until there is a signal to proceed.      Instruction No. 10.      At the time and place and with the vehicles involved in this case, any   speed in excess of 30 miles per hour was unlawful.      2014      "      2010      Instruction No. 11.      You must decide this case by comparing the fault of the parties. In doing   so, you will need to know the meaning of the terms “negligence” and “fault.”      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to do   something that a reasonable person would do, or it is doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      A party is at fault when he or she is negligent and that negligence caused   or contributed to the event which brought about the claim for damages.      I am required to reduce the amount of damages you may find for any   party by the percentage of fault, if any, that you find is attributable to the      party.   A party will be able to recover damages only if that party’s fault is less      than 50 percent of the total fault assigned. A party will not be able to recover   damages, however, if that party’s fault is 50 percent or more.      Instruction No. 12.      When answering questions on the verdict form, you should keep the   following things in mind:      Fault   Your first obligation is to determine if any party is at fault.      2. If you decide that any person is at fault, you must then assign a   percentage of fault to each party you find to be at fault.      For a person not at fault, show 0% on the verdict form.      If you find any person at fault, show 1% to 100% on the verdict   form for that person.      5. If one or more persons are assigned fault, the total of all fault must   be 100%.      Amount of Damages      1. You are to determine the total amount of damages of each party   claiming damages.      2. Your determination of damages must be made without regard to the   percentage of fault you may have assigned to that party.      3. The Court will make any reduction of the damages necessary for the   assigned percentage of fault. You should not do so.      You may assign fault to:      Benton Fender   Betty Bender   The parties you may find received damages are:      Benton Fender                            "      Instruction No. 13.      When determining the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiff, you   must allow the amount of money that will reasonably compensate plaintiff for   his/her injuries and losses resulting from the occurrence in question. These   injuries and losses may include any of the following shown by the evidence:      1. MEDICALEXPENSES. Medical expenses include the reasonable   expenses of necessary medical care, hospitalization and treatment   received as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date and the medical   expenses plaintiff is reasonably expected to incur in the future.     2. ECONOMIC LOSS. Economic loss includes loss of time or   income and losses other than medical expenses incurred as a   result of plaintiff’s injuries to date and the economic loss plaintiff   is reasonably expected to incur in the future.     3. NONECONOMIC LOSS. Noneconomic loss includes pain,   suffering, disabilities, disfigurement and any accompanying   mental anguish suffered as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date   and the noneconomic loss plaintiff is reasonably expected to   suffer in the future.     When determining the amount of plaintiff’s damages you must consider   plaintiff’s age, condition of health before and after the occurrence in question,   and the nature, extent and duration of the plaintiff’s injuries.      If you find plaintiff suffered an injury or injuries and more than minimal   discomfort as a result of the occurrence, then you must compensate the   plaintiff for plaintiff’s pain and suffering. There is no unit value and no   mathematical formula the court can give you for determining items such as   pain, suffering, disability and mental anguish. You must establish an amount   that will fairly and adequately compensate the plaintiff. This amount rests   within your sound discretion.      You must itemize the amounts of damages awarded in this case on the   verdict form.      Instruction No. 14.      When you retire to the jury room you will first select one of your members   to preside over your deliberations, speak for the jury in court, and sign the   verdict upon which you agree.      In this case your verdict will be returned in the form of written answers to   special written questions submitted by the court. Your answers will constitute   your verdict.      Your answer to each question must be by the agreement of ten or more   jurors.      Your verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and   the law as given in these instructions.      2014            "      Date      District Judge      Instruction No. 15.

Weaver. Mr. Weaver and his passenger, Ms. Bea R. Guest, were   also injured.      There is evidence that Mr. Weaver’s blood alcohol content was .19% at   the time of the accident, and there is forensic evidence tending to establish   that his vehicle crossed the center line. The Court has previously permitted an   amendment of the claims against Mr. Weaver to include claims for punitive   damages.      Forensic evidence also tends to establish that Mr. Foote’s auto may have   also crossed the center line.      Each driver has sued the other and both passengers have sued both   drivers.      Mr. Foote suffered the loss of his right leg, destroying his career as a   place kicker for the Chiefs. Ms. Ryder suffered several broken bones and   permanent injuries to her neck and back.

Members of the Jury: It is your duty to follow these instructions. These   instructions are the law in this case and they all must be considered and   applied to the evidence.      During the trial I have ruled upon objections to the admission of evidence.   You must not concern yourselves with the reasons for these rulings and you   must consider only the evidence which is admitted. I have not intended to   indicate any opinion as to what your verdict should be by any ruling that I   have made or anything that I have said or done.      Statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, but may help you   understand the evidence and apply the law. However, you should disregard   any comments of counsel that are not supported by the evidence.      Instruction No. 2.   Burden of proof means burden of persuasion.      For most claims the party that has the burden to prove a claim must   persuade you that the claim is more probably true than not true.      However, a party seeking punitive damages has the burden to prove his   claim for punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence.      Evidence is clear and convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact   asserted is highly probable.      The court will advise you which burden of proof applies to each claim.      In deciding whether this burden has been met, you must consider all   admitted evidence, whether presented by the plaintiff or the defendant.                       "      Instruction No. 3.      It is for you to decide whether the testimony of each witness is believable   and what weight to give that testimony. In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Instruction No. 4.      Certain testimony has been given in this case by experts. Experts   are persons who, from experience, education or training have specialized   knowledge on matters not common to people in general. The law permits   experts to give their opinions about such matters. The testimony of experts   is to be considered like any other testimony and is to be evaluated by the   same tests. You should consider it in connection with all the other facts and   circumstances. You should give it the weight and credit you determine are   appropriate.      Instruction No. 5.      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to   do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      Instruction No. 6.      Wanton conduct is doing something knowing that it is dangerous, and   either being completely indifferent to the danger or recklessly disregarding   the danger.      Instruction No. 7.      Plaintiff, Noah Foote, claims that he sustained damages due to the fault   of the defendant, Bob N. Weaver, in:      1. Crossing the center line of the highway; and   2. Driving while intoxicated.     The plaintiff Foote has the burden to prove that it is more probably true   than not true that he sustained injuries caused by one or more of the claimed   negligent acts or omissions of the defendant Weaver. It is not necessary that   each of you agree upon a specific negligent act or omission.      The plaintiff Foote additionally claims that the defendant Weaver acted   wantonly in driving his automobile while intoxicated. Plaintiff Foote has the   burden to prove this claim by clear and convincing evidence.      Defendant Weaver denies that he was at fault. He claims that plaintiff   Foote was at fault in crossing the center line. Defendant Weaver has the   burden to prove that his claim of fault on the part of plaintiff Foote is more   probably true than not true.      2016      "      2010      Plaintiff Foote denies that he was at fault.      Plaintiff, Ima Ryder, claims that she sustained damages due to the fault   of Noah Foote in crossing the center line in the automobile which he was   driving. She further claims that her damages were also due to the fault of Bob   N. Weaver, in:      1. Crossing the center line in the automobile he was driving; and   2. Driving while he was intoxicated.     Plaintiff Ryder has the burden to prove her claims of fault against   Foote and Weaver are more probably true than not true. As to the defendant   Weaver, it is not necessary that each of you agree upon a specific negligent act   or omission.      Plaintiff Ryder also claims that defendant Weaver acted in a wanton   manner in driving while intoxicated. She has the burden to prove this claim   by clear and convincing evidence.      Defendant Weaver denies he was at fault and denies that plaintiff Ryder   was injured to the extent claimed.      Foote also denies that he was at fault and denies that plaintiff Ryder was   injured to the extent claimed.      Plaintiff, Bea R. Guest, claims that she sustained damages due to the   fault of Noah Foote in crossing the center line in the automobile which he was   driving. She further claims that her damages were also due to the fault of Bob   N. Weaver, in:      1. Crossing the center line in the automobile he was driving; and   2. Driving while he was intoxicated.     Plaintiff Guest has the burden to prove her claims of fault against Foote   and Weaver are more probably true than not true. As to the defendant Weaver,   it is not necessary that each of you agree upon a specific negligent act or   omission.      Plaintiff Guest also claims that defendant Weaver acted in a wanton   manner in driving while intoxicated. She has the burden to prove this claim   by clear and convincing evidence.      Defendant Weaver denies he was at fault and denies that plaintiff Guest   was injured to the extent claimed.      Foote also denies that he was at fault and denies that plaintiff Guest was   injured to the extent claimed.      Defendant and cross-plaintiff, Bob N. Weaver, claims that he sustained   injuries due to the fault of cross-defendant, Noah Foote, in driving his   automobile across the center line of the highway.                              "      Mr. Weaver has the burden to prove that it is more probably true than   not that he sustained injuries due to the claimed negligent act or omission of   Mr. Foote.      Mr. Foote denies he was at fault and denies that Mr. Weaver was injured   to the extent claimed.      Mr. Foote claims that if Mr. Weaver suffered any injuries, it was due to   his own fault, in:      1. Driving his automobile across the center line of the highway; and   2. Driving while intoxicated.     Mr. Foote has the burden to prove that it is more probably true than   not that Mr. Weaver’s injuries were caused by one or more of his negligent   acts. It is not necessary that each of you agree upon a specific negligent act or   omission.      Mr. Weaver denies that his injuries were due to his own fault.      Instruction No. 8.      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. Reasonable care requires all   persons who use the streets and highways to obey the rules of the road. You   must decide from the evidence whether any of the following rules apply in this   case and whether any rules have been violated. The violation of any of these   rules is negligence.      Instruction No. 9.      No person shall drive a vehicle over, upon or across any intervening   space, physical barrier or a clearly indicated dividing section so constructed   as to impede vehicular traffic between roadways on divided highways.      Instruction No. 10.      It is unlawful for any person to operate or attempt to operate any vehicle   while the alcohol concentration in that person’s blood or breath, at the time   or within three hours after the person has operated or attempted to operate   the vehicle, is .08 or more.      A driver who is voluntarily under the influence of alcohol must exercise   the same degree of care under the circumstances then existing as a person   who is not under the influence of alcohol.      Instruction No. 11.      You must decide this case by comparing the fault of the parties. In doing   so, you will need to know the meaning of the terms “negligence” and “fault.”      2014      "      2010      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to   do something that a reasonable person would do, or it is doing something that   a reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      A party is at fault when he or she is negligent and that negligence caused   or contributed to the event which brought about the claim for damages.      I am required to reduce the amount of damages you may find for any   party by the percentage of fault, if any, that you find is attributable to the      party.   A party will be able to recover damages only if that party’s fault is less      than 50 percent of the total fault assigned. A party will not be able to recover   damages, however, if that party’s fault is 50 percent or more.      Instruction No. 12.      When answering questions on the verdict form, you should keep the   following things in mind:   Fault   1. Your first obligation is to determine if any party is at fault.      2. If you decide that any person is at fault, you must then assign a   percentage of fault to each party you find to be at fault.      For a person not at fault, show 0% on the verdict form.      If you find any person at fault, show 1% to 100% on the verdict   form for that person.      5. If one or more persons are assigned fault, the total of all fault must   be 100%.      Amount of Damages      1. You are to determine the total amount of damages of each party   claiming damages.      2. Your determination of damages must be made without regard to the   percentage of fault you may have assigned to that party.      3. The Court will make any reduction of the damages necessary for the   assigned percentage of fault. You should not do so.      You may assign fault to:      Bob N. Weaver   Noah Foote   The parties you may find received damages are:      Noah Foote   Ima Ryder   Bea R. Guest   Bob N. Weaver                              "      Instruction No. 13.      When determining the amount of damages sustained by a party, you   must allow the amount of money that will reasonably compensate the party   for his/her injuries and losses resulting from the occurrence in question. These   injuries and losses may include any of the following shown by the evidence:      1. MEDICAL EXPENSES. Medical expenses include the   reasonable expenses of necessary medical care, hospitalization   and treatment received as a result of a party’s injuries to date   and the medical expenses the party is reasonably expected to   incur in the future.     2. ECONOMIC LOSS. Economic loss includes loss of time or   income and losses other than medical expenses incurred as a   result of a party’s injuries to date and the economic loss the   party is reasonably expected to incur in the future.     3. NONECONOMIC LOSS. Noneconomic loss includes pain,   suffering, disabilities, disfigurement and any accompanying   mental anguish suffered as a result of a party’s injuries to date   and the noneconomic loss the party is reasonably expected to   suffer in the future.     When determining the amount of a party’s damages you must consider     the party’s age, condition of health before and after the occurrence in question,   and the nature, extent and duration of the party’s injuries.      If you find a party suffered an injury or injuries and more than minimal   discomfort as a result of the occurrence, then you must compensate the party   for his or her pain and suffering. There is no unit value and no mathematical   formula the court can give you for determining items such as pain, suffering,   disability and mental anguish. You must establish an amount that will fairly   and adequately compensate the party. This amount rests within your sound   discretion.      You must itemize the amounts of damages awarded in this case on the   verdict form.      Instruction No. 14.      In this case the plaintiffs Noah Foote, Ima Ryder, and Bea R. Guest claim   the defendant Bob N. Weaver acted in a wanton manner toward them. If you   find that Noah Foote, Ima Ryder, or Bea R. Guest is entitled to recover actual   damages against defendant Bob N. Weaver, then you may consider whether   punitive damages should be allowed. Punitive damages may be allowed in   the jury’s discretion to punish a defendant and to deter others from like   conduct.      Aplaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant   acted in a wanton manner toward plaintiff. Evidence is clear and convincing   if it shows that the truth of the fact asserted is highly probable.      2014      "       If you find defendant Bob N. Weaver did one or more of the acts   claimed by plaintiffs Noah Foote, Ima Ryder, and Bea R. Guest, you should   then determine whether the plaintiffs have presented clear and convincing   evidence that the defendant acted in a wanton manner toward them. If you   determine punitive damages should be allowed, your finding must be entered   in the verdict form. After the trial, the court will conduct a separate hearing   to determine the amount of punitive damages to be allowed.      Instruction No. 15.      When you retire to the jury room you will first select one of your members   to preside over your deliberations, speak for the jury in court, and sign the   verdict upon which you agree.      In this case your verdict will be returned in the form of written answers to   special written questions submitted by the court. Your answers will constitute   your verdict.      Your answer to each question must be by the agreement of ten or more   jurors.      Your verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and   the law as given in these instructions.      Date      District Judge      Instruction No. 16.      We, the jury, present the following answers to the questions submitted by   the court:      1. Do you find any of the parties to be at fault?      Yes No      Proceed only if you found any party to be at fault.      2.

Payne, sustained a severe blow to his left leg while at   work on a construction job that was several miles from his home. His employer   took him to the local hospital where he was seen by Dr. Rush and Dr. Bone.   Dr. Rush, an emergency room physician, advised him that he had suffered a   greenstick fracture of the shaft of the fibula and an oblique fracture of the tibia   in his left leg. He was further advised that the bones were in perfect alignment   and that treatment required the application of a leg cast and inactivity of the   leg for several weeks. He was admonished that he could not walk or place   weight on the leg and that he had to use crutches. He agreed to the treatment   and the cast was applied by Dr. Bone, an orthopedic surgeon. He was released   from the hospital with directions to report back within five days or at any   time if the leg became painful.      Twenty days later plaintiff went to his family doctor with complaints   of intense pain and discomfort with the leg. The leg was examined and he   was advised that he had suffered oblique fractures of both fibula and tibia   bones and that the bones were not in proper alignment. He was admitted to   the hospital and was placed in skeletal traction. Subsequently he underwent   surgery that required intramedullary pinning of both bones and extensive   post-operative care and treatment.      Plaintiff filed suit against Dr. Rush and Dr. Bone for malpractice. He   alleged that the doctors were negligent in the treatment of his left leg and that   he had suffered pain and had incurred expenditures for hospitalization and   medical treatment.      Plaintiff also claims that, had he been treated properly in the emergency   room, his chances for a full recovery would have been substantially improved.   He claims that he has suffered a permanent, partial disability to his left leg   due to the negligence of Drs. Bone and Rush, in failing to properly diagnose   the fracture to the fibula (Dr. Rush); and failing to set the bones in proper   alignment, applying the cast too tightly, and releasing him from the hospital   without proper medical care (Dr. Bone).      The defendants deny that they were at fault and allege that Mr. Payne   was negligent in failing to follow medical directions and in walking on or   applying weight to the leg.      2010      "       Outline of Suggested Instructions   Instruction 1.

These   instructions are the law in this case and they all must be considered and   applied to the evidence.      You must consider and weigh only evidence which was admitted during   the trial, including exhibits, admissions, stipulations, and witness testimony   either in person or by deposition.      2010                   "      During the trial I have ruled upon objections to the admission of evidence.   You must not concern yourselves with the reasons for these rulings and you   must consider only the evidence which is admitted. I have not intended to   indicate any opinion as to what your verdict should be by any ruling that I   have made or anything that I have said or done.      Statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, but may help you      understand the evidence and apply the law. However, you should disregard   any comments of counsel that are not supported by the evidence.      Instruction No. 2.   Burden of proof means burden of persuasion.      A party that has the burden to prove a claim must persuade you that the   claim is more probably true than not true. In deciding whether this burden   has been met, you must consider all admitted evidence, whether presented by   the plaintiff or defendant.      Instruction No. 3.      It is for you to decide whether the testimony of each witness is believable   and what weight to give that testimony. In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Instruction No. 4.      The plaintiff, Mr. N. Payne, claims that he was injured due to the fault of   the defendant, Dr. Rush, in failing to properly diagnose the fracture of his left   fibula.      The plaintiff also claims that he was injured due to the fault of the   defendant, Dr. Bone, in:   1. Failing to set the bones in proper alignment;   2. Applying the cast too tightly; and   3. Releasing him from the hospital without proper medical care.     The plaintiff has the burden to prove that it is more probably true than   not true that he sustained injuries caused by any one or more of the claimed   negligent acts or omissions of the defendants. When more than one specified   negligent act or omission is alleged against a defendant, agreement as to which   specific act or omission is not required.      Each defendant denies that he was at fault, and denies that the plaintiff   was injured to the extent claimed.      The defendants claim that plaintiff was at fault in:      1. Failing to follow medical instructions; and   2. Walking on or applying weight to the leg.      2016      "      2016      The defendants have the burden to prove that one or more of these claims   of fault on the part of the plaintiff are more probably true than not true.   When more than one specified negligent act or omission is alleged against a   plaintiff, agreement as to which specific act or omission is not required.      The plaintiff denies that he was at fault.      Instruction No. 5.      Aphysician has a duty to use the learning and skill ordinarily used by other   members of that same field of medicine in the same or similar communities   and circumstances. In using this learning and skill, the physician must also   use ordinary care and diligence. A violation of this duty is a form of negligence   called malpractice.      Instruction No. 6.      In determining whether a physician used the learning, skill, and conduct   required, you are not permitted to arbitrarily set a standard of your own   or determine this question from your personal knowledge. On questions of   medical or scientific nature concerning the standard of care of a physician   only those qualified as experts are permitted to testify. The standard of care   is established by members of the same profession in the same or similar   communities under like circumstances. It follows, therefore, that the only   way you may properly find that standard is through evidence presented by a   physician expert witness.      Instruction No. 7.      A surgeon who holds himself out to be a specialist in a particular field   of medicine must use his skill and knowledge as a specialist in a manner   consistent with the special degree of skill and knowledge ordinarily possessed   by other specialists in the same field of expertise at the time of the diagnosis   and treatment. A violation of this duty is negligence.      Instruction No. 8.      A patient has a duty to follow reasonable directions and advice given to   the patient by a health care provider.      A health care provider has the right to expect a patient to follow   reasonable advice. The failure of a patient to accept reasonable treatment   or follow reasonable advice does not relieve the health care provider from   the results of earlier malpractice. It only absolves him from liability for any   increased injury caused by the patient’s failure to accept reasonable treatment   and advice.      In this case you must decide whether the patient failed to accept reasonable   treatment and advice. If you so find, then you must decide whether that failure                              "      should be considered as failure to mitigate damages, or, in the alternative, as   fault. If you determine conduct to be fault, it cannot also be considered as a   failure to mitigate. Conversely, if you determine conduct to establish a failure   to mitigate, it cannot also be considered as fault.      Instruction No. 9.      In determining the amount of damages sustained by plaintiff, you should   not include any loss which plaintiff could have prevented by reasonable care   and diligence exercised by plaintiff after the loss occurred.      Instruction No. 10.      The plaintiff has claimed that he was denied a substantial chance for   better recovery due to the fault of the defendants. Before you can find the   defendants to be at fault, you must find:      1. That plaintiff would have had a substantial chance for   better recovery if the fracture had been diagnosed and treated   in a timely manner and under the applicable standard of care;   2. That the defendants failed to diagnose and treat plaintiff   in a timely manner and under the applicable standard of care;   and   3. That the resulting injury or lessened degree of recovery   suffered by plaintiff as a result of defendants’ failure was   substantial.   As used in this instruction, a “substantial chance for better recovery” is   one which is capable of being estimated, weighed, judged, or recognized by a   reasonable mind.      Instruction No. 11.      You must decide this case by comparing the fault of the parties. In doing   so, you will need to know the meaning of the terms “negligence” and “fault.”      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care. It is the failure of a person to do   something that a reasonable person would do, or it is doing something that a   reasonable person would not do, under the same circumstances.      A party is at fault when he or she is negligent and that negligence caused   or contributed to the event which brought about the claim for damages.      I am required to reduce the amount of damages you may find for any   party by the percentage of fault, if any, that you find is attributable to the      party.   A party will be able to recover damages only if that party’s fault is less      than 50 percent of the total fault assigned. A party will not be able to recover   damages, however, if that party’s fault is 50 percent or more.      2012      "      2014      Instruction No. 12.      When answering questions on the verdict form, you should keep the   following things in mind:      Fault   Your first obligation is to determine if any party is at fault.      If you decide that any person is at fault, you must then assign a   percentage of fault to each party you find to be at fault.      For a person not at fault, show 0% on the verdict form.      If you find any person at fault, show 1% to 100% on the verdict   form for that person.      If one or more persons are assigned fault, the total of all fault must   be 100%.      Amount of Damages      You are to determine the total amount of damages of each party   claiming damages.      Your determination of damages must be made without regard to the   percentage of fault you may have assigned to that party.      The Court will make any reduction of the damages necessary for the   assigned percentage of fault. You should not do so.      You may assign fault to:      Mr. N. Payne   Dr. Rush   Dr. Bone      The parties you may find received damages are:      Mr. N. Payne      Instruction No. 13.      When determining the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiff, you   must allow the amount of money that will reasonably compensate plaintiff for   his/her injuries and losses resulting from the occurrence in question. These   injuries and losses may include any of the following shown by the evidence:      1.      MEDICALEXPENSES. Medical expenses include the reasonable   expenses of necessary medical care, hospitalization and treatment   received as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date and the medical   expenses plaintiff is reasonably expected to incur in the future.   ECONOMIC LOSS. Economic loss includes loss of time or   income and losses other than medical expenses incurred as a   result of plaintiff’s injuries to date and the economic loss plaintiff   is reasonably expected to incur in the future.                              "      3. NONECONOMIC LOSS. Noneconomic loss includes pain,   suffering, disabilities, disfigurement and any accompanying   mental anguish suffered as a result of plaintiff’s injuries to date   and the noneconomic loss plaintiff is reasonably expected to   suffer in the future.     When determining the amount of plaintiff’s damages you must consider   plaintiff’s age, condition of health before and after the occurrence in question,   and the nature, extent and duration of the plaintiff’s injuries.      If you find plaintiff suffered an injury or injuries and more than minimal   discomfort as a result of the occurrence, then you must compensate the   plaintiff for plaintiff’s pain and suffering. There is no unit value and no   mathematical formula the court can give you for determining items such as   pain, suffering, disability and mental anguish. You must establish an amount   that will fairly and adequately compensate the plaintiff. This amount rests   within your sound discretion.      You must itemize the amounts of damages awarded in this case on the   verdict form.      Instruction No. 14.      When you retire to the jury room you will first select one of your members   to preside over your deliberations, speak for the jury in court, and sign the   verdict upon which you agree.      In this case your verdict will be returned in the form of written answers to   special written questions submitted by the Court. Your answers will constitute   your verdict.      Your answer to each question must be by the agreement of ten or more   jurors.      Your verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and   the law as given in these instructions.      Date      District Judge      2014      "       Instruction No. 15.      We, the jury, present the following answers to the questions submitted by   the Court:      1. Do you find Mr. N.

Byers, a wine wholesaler, alleges that Mr. Cellars breached his   contract to deliver to Byers 1,500 cases of fine wines. What Mr. Cellars (whose   motto is “We will sell no wine before it is paid for”) actually delivered to   Byers was 1,500 cases of vinegar.      Byers also alleges that Mr. Cellars was fully aware that the wine had   turned to vinegar prior to shipping it, and Byers was granted leave to amend   his petition to include a claim for punitive damages based on fraud.      Mr. Cellars denies that he breached the contract and denies that he knew   prior to shipping the wine that it had turned to vinegar. Further, he alleges that   if, in fact, the wine had turned to vinegar, Byers failed to mitigate its damages   by not wholesaling the wine vinegar to a manufacturer of salad dressings.

PIK 4" -A, Verdict Form—Special Verdict      TEXT OF SUGGESTED INSTRUCTIONS      Instruction No. 1.      Members of the Jury: It is your duty to follow these instructions. These   instructions are the law in this case and they all must be considered and   applied to the evidence.      You must consider and weigh only evidence which was admitted during   the trial, including exhibits, admissions, stipulations, and witness testimony   either in person or by deposition.      During the trial I have ruled upon objections to the admission of evidence.   You must not concern yourselves with the reasons for these rulings and you   must consider only the evidence which is admitted. I have not intended to   indicate any opinion as to what your verdict should be by any ruling that I   have made or anything that I have said or done.      Statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, but may help you   understand the evidence and apply the law. However, you should disregard   any comments of counsel that are not supported by the evidence.      Corporations are entitled to the same fair and impartial treatment as an   individual.      Instruction No. 2.   Burden of proof means burden of persuasion.      For most kinds of claims, the party that has the burden to prove a claim   must persuade you that the claim is more probably true than not true.      It is the law of this state that to prove fraud it is necessary for the party   claiming fraud to prove it by evidence that is clear and convincing.      Evidence is clear and convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact   asserted is highly probable.      In deciding whether the required burden of proof has been met, you   must consider all admitted evidence, whether presented by the plaintiff or the   defendant.                              "      Instruction No. 3.      It is for you to decide whether the testimony of each witness is believable   and what weight to give that testimony. In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Instruction No. 4.      Plaintiff, Claude Byers, Inc., claims that it sustained damages due to the   breach of a contract by the defendant, Julio Cellars. Plaintiff further claims   that the defendant’s actions constituted fraud.      The plaintiff has the burden to prove its claim of breach of contract is   more probably true than not true. The plaintiff has the burden to prove its   claim of fraud by clear and convincing evidence.      The defendant denies that he breached his contract with the plaintiff,   and further denies that his actions constituted fraud.      The defendant also contends that plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages.   The burden is on the defendant to prove that his claim of failure to mitigate   damages is more probably true than not true.      Instruction No. 5.      A contract is an agreement between two or more persons consisting of a   promise that is legally enforceable.      Instruction No. 6.      A contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement. It   may be oral or written, or implied from the conduct of the parties.      Instruction No. 7.      If you find for Claude Byers, Inc., then you should award Claude Byers,   Inc. the sum you find will fairly and justly compensate Claude Byers, Inc.   for the damages you find were sustained as a direct result of the breach of   contract by Julio Cellars.      In determining Claude Byers, Inc.’s damages you should consider any   of the following elements of damage that you find were the result of the   breach:      $300,, the purchase price of the 1,500 cases of wine.      The total amount of your verdict may not exceed the sum of $300,,   the amount of Claude Byers, Inc.’s claim.      2016      "      2016      Instruction No. 8.   The essential elements required to sustain an action for fraud are:      1. That false or untrue representations were made as a   statement of existing and material fact.     2. That the representations were known to be false or untrue   by the party making them, or were recklessly made without   knowledge concerning them.     3. That the representations were intentionally made for the   purpose of inducing another party to act upon them.     4. That the other party reasonably relied and acted upon the   representations made.     5. That the other party sustained damage by relying upon   them.     A representation is material when it relates to some matter that is so   substantial as to influence the party to whom it was made.      Instruction No. 9.      The plaintiff claims the defendant acted in a fraudulent manner toward   plaintiff. If you award the plaintiff actual damages then you may consider   whether punitive damages should be allowed. Punitive damages may be   allowed in the jury’s discretion to punish a defendant and to deter others   from like conduct.      The plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the   defendant acted in a fraudulent manner toward plaintiff. Evidence is clear and   convincing if it shows that the truth of the fact asserted is highly probable.      If you find the defendant did one or more of the acts claimed by the   plaintiff you should then determine whether the plaintiff has presented clear   and convincing evidence that the defendant acted in a fraudulent manner   toward plaintiff. If you determine punitive damages should be allowed, your   finding must be entered in the verdict form. After the trial, the court will   conduct a separate hearing to determine the amount of punitive damages to   be allowed.      Instruction No. 10.      If you find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for breach of   the contract, then in fixing the amount of damages you should not include any   loss that it could have prevented by reasonable care and diligence.      Instruction No. 11.      When you retire to the jury room, you will first select one of your members   to preside over your deliberations, speak for the jury in court, and sign the   verdict form upon which you agree.

If you answered “yes” to question 1, what amount of   damages do you find was sustained by the plaintiff? $      3.

Plaintiff, P. R. Ohner, owned a 40 acre parcel. A five acre strip was taken to   construct the new highway. The strip taken contained approximately 1,300   feet of hedgerow which plaintiff claimed had significant value as an “historical   treeline.” K.D.O.T. claimed the hedgerow had no value.

These   instructions are the law in this case and they all must be considered and   applied to the evidence.      You must consider and weigh only evidence which was admitted during   the trial, including exhibits, admissions, stipulations, and witness testimony   either in person or by deposition.      2014                   "      Instruction No. 2.      The Kansas Department of Transportation is entitled to the same fair   and impartial treatment as an individual.      Instruction No. 3.      It is for you to decide whether the testimony of each witness is believable   and what weight to give that testimony. In making these decisions, you have   a right to use your common knowledge and experience.      Instruction No. 4.      Certain testimony has been given in this case by experts. Experts are   persons who, from experience or training have specialized knowledge on   matters not common to people in general. The law permits experts to give   their opinions about such matters. The testimony of experts is to be considered   like any other testimony and is to be evaluated by the same tests. You should   consider it in connection with all the other facts and circumstances. You   should give it the weight and credit you determine are appropriate.      Instruction No. 5.      Kansas Department of Transportation has in this proceeding through   its lawful power of eminent domain taken property, as well as a temporary   interest in property, for a public use. Your duty is to determine the amount of   compensation that should be paid the owner for the taking.      Instruction No. 6.      Only part of the owner’s property was taken in this proceeding. The   property taken was 5 acres of cropland, which included trees located along   1,320 feet of a hedgerow which formed the border of the land taken. The   owner is left with 35 acres. The measure of compensation you should award   under these circumstances is the difference between the fair market value of   the entire property immediately before the taking and the fair market value   of the property remaining with the owner immediately after the taking. The   date of taking was September 1, 2014.      To arrive at a proper award in this proceeding, your first obligation is   to determine the fair market value of the entire property immediately before   the taking. Your finding must fall within the range of testimony as to the fair   market value immediately before the taking.      Next, determine the value of the property remaining with the owner   immediately after the taking. Your finding must fall within the range of   testimony as to the value immediately after the taking.      2016      "       Finally, subtract your finding of the value of the property remaining   immediately after the taking from your finding of the value of the entire   property immediately before the taking. The difference is the amount of your   award.      In determining the value of the property, you must consider all of the   circumstances shown by the evidence that reasonably bear on the issue of   value of the property including the following factors:      (a) The use of the property remaining;     (b) The loss of trees and shrubbery;     (c) The loss of fences and the cost of replacing them with fences     of like quality; and     (d) The loss or damage to growing crops.     The above factors are not to be considered by you as separate items of     damage, but are to be considered only as they affect the fair market value of   the property.      Instruction No. 7.      To arrive at an award in this proceeding, you need to know the meaning   of “fair market value.”      Fair market value is the amount in terms of money that a well-informed   buyer is justified in paying and a well-informed seller is justified in accepting   for property in an open and competitive market, assuming that the parties   are acting without undue compulsion.      Fair market value shall be determined by use of (1) the comparable sales   method, which values the property based upon the recent sales of comparable   property; (2) the depreciated replacement cost method, which values the   property based upon the reproduction cost of the property less depreciation;   (3) the capitalization of income method, which values the property based upon   the capitalization of net income form the property; or (4) any combination of   these methods.      In determining fair market value, you should consider all of the possible   uses to which the property could have been put, including the best and most   advantageous use to which the property was reasonably adaptable, but your   considerations must not be speculative, conjectural, or remote. The uses which   may be considered must have been so reasonably probable as to have had an   effect on the fair market value of the property at the time of the taking.      2016                   "      Instruction No. 8.      When you retire to the jury room, you will first select one of your   members to preside over your deliberations and speak for the jury in court.   The presiding juror shall complete and sign the verdict form.      Your verdict must be by ten or more jurors in this case.      Your verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and   the law as given in these instructions.      Date      District Judge      Instruction No. 9.
