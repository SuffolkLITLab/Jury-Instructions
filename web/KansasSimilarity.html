    <h1>Kansas Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to run a similarities between jury instructions. The "base" jury instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive.
    The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. 
    Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. 
    Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared; both internally within the jury instruction and externally with a different jurisdiction's jury instruction.</p>
<hr><h4><a class="anchor" name='101.01' href='#101.01'></a>101.01</h4><p>JURY HANDBOOK USAGE RECOMMENDED      The Committee has reorganized and updated the handbook for jurors   that follows as PIK 4 . The handbook is intended to provide basic   information about the jury trial process in an effort to anticipate and answer   many of the questions that prospective jurors often have. It can be mailed to   prospective jurors with their summons, handed to them as they arrive at the   courthouse, or the judge may choose to read all or parts of it to prospective   jurors before or during jury selection. However judges choose to approach   jury orientation and jury selection, the Committee simply recommends that   the handbook be utilized in some fashion.      When orienting or selecting a jury, the trial judge must take care to   be accurate when describing the law or trial procedure and to avoid any   comment(s) that might be perceived as indicating bias or a suggestion as to   how the judge would resolve any of the factual issues in the case.      Comment      A number of cases through the years have involved a claim of error predicated upon comments made   by the trial judge during jury orientation or selection. See State v. Reuter, 126 Kan. 565, 268 Pac. 845   (1928); State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.3d 139 (2001); State v. Plunkett, 257 Kan. 135, 891 P.2d 370   (1995).     The trial court’s jury orientation comments will be reviewed on appeal under the judicial misconduct   standard of review. It must affirmatively appear that the conduct was of such a nature as to prejudice   the substantial rights of the complaining party. State v. Nguyen, 251 Kan. 69, 833 P.2d 937, Syl.

The Importance of Jury Service      Jury service is a serious obligation of all qualified citizens, and is a vital   part of our American system of justice. By carrying out their task well and   faithfully, jurors help resolve controversies, enforce our laws, and preserve   the legal rights of our citizens.      II. Excuses From Jury Duty      Excuses from jury duty should be sought only for reasons of compelling   personal hardship or because requiring jury service would be contrary to the   public health, safety or welfare. Although jury service can be inconvenient or   financially burdensome, experience has shown that most jurors feel that any   such inconvenience or personal expense is far outweighed by the value and   importance of jury service to the community at large. If you believe that you   cannot or should not be required to serve as a juror in this case, you will have   the opportunity to state your reasons to the judge.      III. Composition of Jury Panel      Parties have the right to juries selected from a fair cross section of the   county in which the court convenes. As such, prospective jurors are selected   at random from county voter registration records or lists of licensed drivers   or persons holding state-issued identification cards who reside in the county,   and/or census records.      IV. Civil and Criminal Cases      In civil cases, parties generally claim that their person or property has   been injured or damaged by the wrongful act of another. Money is normally   sought as compensation for the claimed injury. Parties in civil cases may also   seek a court order establishing or enforcing contractual or other legal rights   or obligations. Examples of civil cases would be motor vehicle accident cases   or real estate contract disputes. The person bringing the suit is the plaintiff,   and the party being sued is the defendant.      Criminal cases are those in which the plaintiff is generally the State of   Kansas and is represented by the prosecuting attorney who starts the case   by filing a complaint alleging that the defendant has violated the law in      2016                 "      some respect. The defendant is presumed to be innocent of all charges. The   prosecutor must establish the defendant’s guilt by proof beyond a reasonable   doubt. The defendant is not required to present evidence.      V. Role of the Attorneys, Judge, and Jury      Attorneys have the obligation to represent their clients in a competent   and professional manner. They present evidence to support the claims of   their clients. They may challenge or question the evidence presented by other   parties to the lawsuit. At times they will object to certain evidence offered by   the other parties if they believe that such evidence should not be admitted.      The judge has the duty to decide what evidence may be received and   considered by the jury; to control the progress of the trial; to rule on all   questions of law; and to instruct the jury on the law that applies to a given   case.      The jury has the duty to listen closely to all of the evidence presented by   any party; to determine from that evidence what the facts of the case are; to   apply those facts to the law as instructed by the judge; and thus to arrive at a   verdict in the case.      At times during the trial the judge and attorneys may discuss matters   at the bench or otherwise outside your view or hearing. These conferences   are necessary for various reasons, such as to resolve issues concerning the   admissibility of certain evidence. Judges try to keep these conferences as few   and brief as possible.      VI. Jury Selection Process      On the first day of trial, prospective jurors are given an oath to honestly   answer questions concerning their qualifications to sit as jurors in the case.   This questioning process is called voir dire, a French term meaning “to speak   the truth.” The questioning is done by the judge or by the attorneys, and   sometimes both, and is intended to determine if prospective jurors have any   personal interest in or knowledge of the case; whether they are related to or   personally acquainted with the parties or their attorneys; or whether they, for   whatever reason, have a personal feeling or bias that would make it difficult   for them to be fair and impartial to both sides of the case.      During the questioning of prospective jurors, a person may be challenged   for cause if it is shown that he or she would not be an appropriate juror for   the particular case. The judge will excuse the person from the panel if the   cause given is deemed sufficient. Once the questioning of prospective jurors   is complete, the parties will then exercise a certain number of challenges for   which no cause is necessary. These are known as peremptory challenges. The      2010      "      2010      peremptory challenge is a legal right long recognized as a means of giving both   sides some choice in the make-up of the jury. Jurors should understand that   being removed from the jury panel for cause or by a peremptory challenge is   no reflection upon their ability or integrity.      The judge may also decide to select one or more alternate jurors to serve   in the place of regular jurors who become unable to fulfill their duties at some   point during the trial. Alternate jurors may be selected at the same time the   regular jurors are selected, or after the regular jury has been selected. Alternate   jurors are selected in the same manner, and have the same qualifications and   duties as regular jurors.      VIL. Stages of the Trial      A. Opening Statement. Once the jury has been selected, the attorneys are   entitled to make opening statements outlining what they believe the   evidence in the case will be. These statements are intended to help the   jury in following and understanding the evidence as it is presented.      B. Presentation of Evidence. Following opening statements, the parties   then present the testimony of witnesses and other forms of evidence   in an effort to prove their claims in the lawsuit, or in an effort to   disprove the claims of the other party. Defendants are not required to   present evidence.      C. Instructions By the Judge. Once the parties have presented all of   their evidence, the judge will then prepare and read to the jury a set of   instructions outlining the law that applies to the particular case. The   jurors will take these instructions with them to the jury room to serve   as their guide in the deliberation process.      D. Final Arguments. Following the reading of the jury instructions by   the judge, the attorneys are then entitled to make final arguments in   which they state what they believe the evidence has been and how   the evidence should be viewed and applied in light of the judge’s   instructions.      E. Deliberation and Verdict. The jury will first select one of its members   as presiding juror to sign the verdict form and to speak for the jury   in open court. In a criminal case, the jury’s verdict as to any crime   charged must be unanimous, that is, all jurors must agree upon   the verdict. In a civil case, the agreement of 10 out of 12 jurors is   sufficient.                            VIII. Courtroom Etiquette      The courtroom is a place where all persons should conduct themselves   with dignity, courtesy and proper respect for the court and everyone present.   Noisy or disruptive conduct is not allowed. The clothing worn by jurors may   be casual but should be appropriate for the serious business of the court.   Hats and caps should be removed upon entering the courtroom. If cellular   phones are allowed in the courthouse, they must be turned off at all times   in the courtroom. Newspapers, magazines, books, etc. should be put away.   Quiet and close attention to the proceedings at hand is the order of the day.      IX. Conduct of the Jury During Trial      Each juror must pay close attention to the testimony and keep an open   mind throughout the trial. Jurors can and should use the knowledge they   possess in common with persons in general. Jurors are encouraged to use   their common sense.      Until all of the evidence has been presented and the final instructions   given by the judge, jurors must not discuss the case among themselves or with   anyone else, including anyone outside the courthouse. If anyone attempts to   talk with a juror about the case, the juror should tell this person that such   conversation is not proper and should cease. The juror should also report the   matter to the bailiff at the earliest opportunity.      Jurors must receive all of their information about the case from the trial   itself, and must not rely on any other source of information. Jurors must not   search for, read or listen to any information from the internet relating in any   way to the case. Jurors must avoid listening to, reading or viewing any media   coverage of the case. If during the trial a juror learns some information about   the case outside the trial, the juror should inform the judge. He or she must   not mention any such information to other jurors. Jurors must never inspect   the scene where the events occurred. If such an inspection is necessary, the   judge will have the jurors go as a group to the scene.      Once the case has been submitted to the jury for deliberation of a verdict,   jurors should freely exchange their views and should give proper consideration   to the views of other jurors. No juror is required to abandon any opinion   which the juror believes is correct, but jurors should be willing to change   their opinion if they become convinced by other jurors that such opinion is   not correct.      "      2010      "      2010      X. Accommodating the Needs and Concerns of Jurors      Understanding that jury service can at times be a burden, the judge and   staff will make every effort to minimize any inconveniences. Depending on   the particular county in which the case is handled, information regarding   parking, dining establishments, cellular phone use, disability accommodations,   etc. may be separately provided. Although some cases are shorter in duration   and some can be much longer, the average jury trial takes 2-3 days. Except in   very rare instances, you will be allowed to return home each evening.      During the trial, if you cannot hear the proceeding, or need to take a   restroom break, just raise your hand and let the judge know. If you have   other concerns regarding your comfort or convenience or that of other jurors,   do not hesitate to express that concern to the bailiff during a break in the   proceedings.

Whether you do so is entirely up to you. However, do not allow the taking of   notes to distract you from listening attentively to the testimony of a witness.      You may use your notes to refresh your memory as you deliberate.   However, your deliberations must be based upon the collective memory and   recollection of the entire jury as to the evidence admitted. Notes should be   used only as an aid to this function and not as a substitute.      You must not remove any of your notes from the courthouse. At the   beginning of a recess give your packet of notes to the bailiff. Your notes will   be returned to you when court reconvenes.      At the conclusion of the trial, all notes must be given to the bailiff for   immediate destruction.      Comment      The court may wish to consider the anticipated length of the trial, the technical nature of the subjects   about which the witnesses will testify, and the amount of detail that must be sifted through by the jurors in   order to be competent fact finders.     Note taking by jurors is a matter of “sound judicial discretion.” State v. Jackson, 201 Kan. 795, 799,   443 P.2d 279 (1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 908, 89 S. Ct. 1019, 22 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1969) overruled on other   grounds in State v. Mims, 220 Kan. 726, 556 P.2d 387 (1976). A more comprehensive review of the subject   is contained in 14 A.L.R. 3d 831.     Permitting note taking without having first given the note taking instruction will be judged according   to the “clearly erroneous” standard of review. State v. Diggs, 272 Kan. 349, 8, 34 P.3d 63 (2001).      2010      "      2018      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 00.090'> 00.090</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 02.700'> 02.700</a> (98%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 76.500'> 76.500</a> (98%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 02.510'> 02.510</a> (98%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 02.530'> 02.530</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name='101.12' href='#101.12'></a>101.12</h4><p>INSTRUCTION FOR IMPANELED JURORS      Now that you have been chosen as jurors for this trial, you are required   to decide this case only on the evidence admitted. At the end of the case, I   will instruct you on the law that you must apply to the evidence in order to   reach a verdict. For your verdict to be fair, you must not be exposed to any   information about the case, the law, or any of the issues involved in this trial   beyond that which is admitted during the trial.      Do not seek information about the case beyond what you see and   hear in this courtroom. Do not use any printed or electronic sources to get   information about this case or any of the issues involved. These sources   include the internet, reference books, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines,   television, radio, computers, smartphones, or any other electronic device. You   must not do any personal investigation about the issues, including visiting any   of the places involved in this case, or use Internet maps or Google Earth to   examine the scene. You cannot talk to any possible witnesses, or create your   own demonstrations or re-enactments of the events which are the subject of   this case.      Do not communicate with anyone about this case or your jury service,   and do not allow anyone to communicate with you. In particular, you may not   talk about the case by using cell phones, emails, text messages, tweets, blogs,   chat rooms, comments or other postings on Facebook or any other website.   You may notify your family and your employer that you have been seated as a   juror in the case. But, if you are asked or approached by anyone, in any way,   about your jury service or anything about this case, you must respond that   you have been ordered not to discuss the matter. You should then report the   contact to the bailiff of the court as soon as possible.      The court recognizes that these rules and restrictions may affect activities   that you would consider to be normal and harmless. However, the law requires   these restrictions to ensure the parties have a fair trial based on the evidence   that each party has had an opportunity to produce and discuss.      Any juror who violates these rules and restrictions jeopardizes the   fairness of these proceedings. Violations may be punished as contempt of   court. In addition, a mistrial could result, causing the entire trial process to   start over. If you become aware that a juror has done something that violates   these instructions, you must report that to the court.      These rules and restrictions remain in effect until you have been   discharged from your jury service.                  "      Notes on Use      The Committee recommends that this instruction be read to the jury at the start of every trial.

II. PURPOSE OF VOIR DIRE      As prospective jurors you will be called and questioned so that the Court   may determine your qualifications to serve in this case. The Court and the   attorneys conduct this examination to obtain a fair and impartial jury and   not to pry into your personal affairs. Because this is an important part of the   trial, the law requires that prospective jurors be sworn before questions are   asked. The Clerk will administer the oath.      HI. OATH FOR VOIR DIRE      You, and each of you, do solemnly swear that you will true answers make   to all questions propounded to you by court or counsel, touching upon your   qualifications to serve as jurors in this case, so help you God?      Comment     Kansas Statutes recognizes the right of participation in this examination by the Court and by counsel.   The Committee believes the following are not proper areas for examination:     1. Questions previously asked by Court or counsel, and answered.     2. Questions touching upon anticipated instructions.                  "      3. Questions touching upon the verdict to be returned when those questions are based upon     hypothetical facts and situations.     4. Questions that are in substance arguments of the case.     Additionally, the Committee believes that voir dire is best conducted when questions are not asked   relative to data available from jury information sheets obtainable from the clerk and when collective   questions are used as fully as practicable. Such restrictions as those found above may be made known to   counsel by rule or informal statement.       2012      "      2016      <p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 22.001'> 22.001</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 02.700'> 02.700</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 23.701'> 23.701</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 00.080'> 00.080</a> (98%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 00.030'> 00.030</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name='101.30' href='#101.30'></a>101.30</h4><p>RECESS INSTRUCTIONS      During this recess you must not talk about this case with any other person   nor allow any other person to discuss the case with you.

Notes on Use      When giving this instruction for the first time or at the end of each day, the judge may want to include   all or portions of PIK 4" , Base Your Decision As A Juror On What Is Presented In Court, to augment   the recess admonition.      Comment      The trial judge should admonish the jury pursuant to K.S.A. 60-248(d) whenever the jury is permitted   to separate during the trial. But prejudicial error will not be presumed from such failure in the absence of a   showing of substantial prejudicial misconduct on the part of the jurors resulting from a failure to give the   statutory admonishment. The party claiming prejudice has the burden of proof. Hawkinson v. Bennett, 265   Kan. 564, 566, 962 P.2d 445 (1998).

A number of the instructions that follow this instruction may   be combined at the discretion of the judge, who may give only those that he or she feels are necessary in   each case.
