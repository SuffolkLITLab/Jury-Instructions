Marcus B. Calhoun 


"Judge Marcus Calhoun was one of the moving forces in drafting and publishing standard, or "
"“pattern,” jury charges for use throughout Georgia. For many years, he was chair of the "
Pattern Jury Instructions Committee of the Council of Superior Court Judges of Georgia. The 
suggested pattern jury instructions have achieved widespread acceptance in large part 
because of the tireless efforts of Judge Calhoun. 


"Judge Marcus B. Calhoun was born on June 7, 1917, in Mt. Vernon, Georgia. His father, "
"also named Marcus B. Calhoun, was an attorney in the private practice of law in "
"Montgomery County, Georgia, until his death in 1934. His mother, the former Annie "
"Griffith of Athens, Georgia, taught music at Brewton Parker College. "


Judge Calhoun received an associate degree from Brewton Parker College in 1936. Further 
"education was interrupted by the death of his father and the Great Depression, so he entered "
"the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), where he worked clearing swamp land in "
"southeastern Georgia. Upon leaving the CCC, he moved to Atlanta, where he secured "
employment as an investigator/adjuster for an insurance company while attending Atlanta 
"Law School at night. Upon receiving his LL.B. from the Atlanta Law School, he was "
admitted to the practice of law in Georgia in 1939. 


"Judge Calhoun first used his law degree to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), "
"where he served from 1940 through 1945. During that time, he was assigned as a special "
"agent in the Baltimore, New York, and Atlanta offices of the FBI. While he worked on all "


"types of matters handled by the Bureau, his primary focus during the war years was directed "
toward uncovering Nazi espionage. 


"In 1946, Judge Calhoun left the FBI and moved to Thomasville, Georgia, to join Frank L. "
"Forester in what, for twenty-one years, would remain the two-man firm of Forester &amp; "
Calhoun. Judge Calhoun was the trial lawyer in what was essentially a small-town general 
"practice. During the 1950s, he was appointed solicitor for the City Court of Thomasville, a "
part-time position he retained until he was appointed district attorney of the Southern 
Judicial Circuit in 1967. 


"In April 1969, Judge Calhoun was appointed to the Superior Court Bench by Gov. Lester "
"Maddox. He served in that capacity until accepting senior judge status on April 15, 1979. He "
continued to serve as a senior judge until his death in April 1998. During most of his tenure 
"as a senior judge, he also remained active on the Pattern Jury Committee. "


"Judge Calhoun married the former Bernice Wolfe of Wilkes County, Georgia, on June 15, "
1940. Mrs. Calhoun died in 1999. They had three sons and one daughter. All three sons are 
"graduates of the University of Georgia School of Law: Marcus Benton Calhoun, Jr., is a "
"practicing attorney with the Columbus, Georgia, firm of Page, Scrantom, Sprouse, Tucker &amp; "
"Ford; William M. Calhoun is a member of the faculty of the U.S. Navy War College, "
"Providence, Rhode Island; and Samuel W. Calhoun is a professor of law at Washington and "
"Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Their daughter, Bernice Calhoun Freed, died in "
"November 2000. She was a teacher, farmer, artist, and entrepreneur residing in Guatemala at "
the time. There are 12 Calhoun grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. 





In Memory of 
Rowland W. Barnes 


"On March 11, 2005, Judge Rowland W. Barnes lost his life while serving on the bench in "
"the Superior Court of Fulton County, one of four people who were killed on that tragic "
day. The Judges of the Superior Court of Georgia wish to honor Judge Barnes as a 
"respected peer, an admired jurist, and a good friend. "


"Judge Barnes was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming. A 1962 graduate of Lebanon Valley "
"College in Annville, Pennsylvania, he played on the 1961 Middle Atlantic Conference "
championship football team. He attended law school at George Washington University 
"and Emory University, graduating from Emory in 1972. He served in the U.S. Air Force "
"from 1962 until 1970, working at bases in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Alabama and "
attaining the rank of first lieutenant. He was an attorney for the Department of Housing 
"and Urban Development and worked in real estate, family law, and litigation, mostly as a "
sole practitioner. 


"His judicial career started in the early 1980s, when he served as a city court judge in "
"College Park, Fairburn, and Hapeville, Georgia. In 1987, he began serving as a part-time "
"Fulton County Magistrate. In 1998, Judge Barnes was selected by then-governor Zell "
Miller to become a superior court judge in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit. “I knew the judge 
"well. It was one of my proudest appointments,” said Miller. "


"Judge Barnes was an active member of the Pattern Jury Instruction Committee, offering "
many suggestions that have been incorporated into the Suggested Pattern Jury 
"Instructions, both civil and criminal cases, used by all judges throughout the state on a "
"daily basis in charging juries. As such, he was selected to serve as chairman of the "
"subcommittee to revise, update, and improve the instructions dealing with civil matters. "
He supervised the project and the many judges who worked on and completed what is 


"now the fourth edition of the civil case instructions, released in July 2004. The work has "
received favorable comments by trial and appellate judges and lawyers throughout the 
State. 


"Though blessed with great intellectual capacity, Judge Barnes was better known for his "
"kindly and disarming demeanor. He will be sorely missed, not only in his home "
"jurisdiction but by judges throughout Georgia. Judge Barnes is survived by his wife, "
"Claudia, two daughters, four stepchildren, and fourteen grandchildren. This volume is "
dedicated to the memory of Rowland W. Barnes.

PREFACE 


The art of charging a jury is one of the most refined duties of a trial judge. . . . [T]he 
trial judge in each case has the unique task of objectively and clearly explaining to 
the jury . . . the applicable law which governs the facts they find to be true. This must 
be done in such a manner that no harmful error is committed in stating or failing to 
"state . . . the law, but more importantly, should be done in simple, straightforward, "


and understandable language for the layperson. 


"Senior Judge James B. O’Connor, "
"Oconee Judicial Circuit, "


"Past Member, Pattern Jury Instructions Committee "


The Pattern Jury Instructions Committee of the Council of Superior Court Judges of Georgia 
hopes these suggested jury instructions for civil cases will be useful and informative in 
dealing with most of the issues that confront judges daily in the trial courts by making 
"available accurate instructions in modern, lay language. "

These instructions are submitted as suggestions only. They have not been submitted 
"to or approved by the appellate courts of Georgia, although many have been approved in "
"principle in specific cases. There are two basic problems with relying on any standard, or "


"pattern, instruction: "


"1) No suggested charges can cover every situation, and the task will ever belong to the "
trial judge to “tailor” or adapt the charge material to the case on trial. Each judge 
"must carefully adjust these charges, removing all language not applicable and "
making changes and additions required to fit the case on trial when necessary. At 
"times, minor adjustments will suffice, but a careful rewriting of an entire suggested "
charge may be required. 

"2) The law is constantly changing, and new, possibly unanticipated facts may render a "
standard charge—even an otherwise correct one—inappropriate in certain 
circumstances. Although the committee meets frequently and stays in touch by 
"various means of communication, it is possible that a change may occur before the "


committee can adequately respond with a caveat or revised charge. 


Both the committee and the council recognize that the responsibility of instructing 
the jury rests solely with the trial judge. There is much greater danger in overcharging than 
"in undercharging a jury, and judges are encouraged to charge only on the principles required "
and no others. 

The language contained in these instructions is intended to be gender neutral to the 
extent feasible. There will be instances in which the judge will need to make adjustments for 
singular versus plural pronouns for defendants or victims. In those instances in which there 
"is an option, the judge should select the appropriate pronoun. "

"The committee has made some necessary changes for the sake of accuracy, clarity, and "
"even safety; for the most part, however, there is little substantive change in the fifth edition. "
The main change is the addition of a new section on child support charges. As this section 
"was created to assist in implementing the new child support guidelines, the committee invites "
your feedback on the charges to allow us to refine them. 

The assistance of all Georgia judges is needed to keep these suggested instructions 
updated. It is requested that each trial judge carefully review this material and provide the 
committee with suggestions for additions or improvements to these instructions. 
"Suggestions may be sent to Pattern Jury Instructions Committee, Council of Superior Court "
"Judges, 18 Capitol Square, Suite 104, Atlanta, Georgia 30334, or to any member of the "
committee. 

The judges listed below composed the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee for the 


"fifth edition of Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Volume I: Civil Cases, State of "


Georgia.

2 Preface 


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 


"Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, by its nature, is and must be a work in progress. All "
members of the current Pattern Jury Instructions Committee contributed innumerable hours 
"in reviewing, researching, revising, and editing. But to credit just the committee would be "
an egregious oversight. The current committee started with a product that was already 
"highly “refined”; to paraphrase Sir Isaac Newton, we truly “stood on the shoulders of "
"giants.” In addition, many of the additions or corrections came not from the membership of "
the committee but from the many judges who have previously served on the committee or 
who have responded to our solicitation for input and assistance from the trial bench. In 
"short, there are too many to adequately acknowledge. "

"Still, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the contributions of Judge "
Rowland Barnes of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit and Judge David Barrett of the Enotah 
Judicial Circuit. Revision of the civil instructions was a more voluminous task than the 
criminal revision in that there was simply a greater amount of and more diverse subject 
"matter to review. Secondly, there was more need for change. Judge Barnes chaired this most "
"recent revision of the civil pattern jury instructions and, through his personal effort in "
"reviewing and consolidating the many submissions, is due much of the credit for the "
completion of this project. Judge Barrett is Vice Chairman of the Pattern Jury Instructions 
"Committee of the Council of Superior Court Judges of Georgia. His contribution, not only "
"to this effort but to the work of the committee as a whole for many years, has been "
invaluable. It is not too much to say that he is largely responsible for the quality of both the 


civil and criminal instructions.

00.000 Evidence; Note Regarding Changes Based upon New Evidence Code 


"(Introduction—Georgia Law 2011, p. 99, which adopted the new evidence code, (the "
"Georgia version of the Federal Rules) included, in pertinent part, the following preamble: "
“Tt is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this Act to adopt the Federal 
"Rules of Evidence, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States and the United "
"States circuit courts of appeal as of January 1, 2013 to the extent that such interpretation is "
consistent with the Constitution of Georgia. Where conflicts were found to exist among the 
"decisions of the various circuit courts of appeal interpreting the federal rules of evidence, "


the General Assembly considered the decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . The 





General Assembly is cognizant that there are many issues regarding evidence that are not 
covered by the Federal Rules of Evidence and in those situations the former provisions of 
"Title 24 have been retained. Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the "
General Assembly intends that the substantive law of evidence in Georgia as it existed on 


"December 31, 2012 be retained.” [emphasis added] "





"Consistent with the foregoing, the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee has reviewed "
all old charges on evidence and made changes keeping in mind the new rules and added 
other refinements we felt were needed. Some old charges were retained even where 
"underlying statutes have been repealed or replaced. In most such instances, it was felt the "
old charge could do no harm. The committee has also taken some charges from the I 1th 


Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions we felt were clearer and complied with Georgia Law. 


00.005 Preliminary General Instructions (Civil): Before Introduction 
of Evidence 
(Note: Preliminary instructions are optional and are included in this charge book for use by 
those judges who feel they would be helpful to jurors. Many judges use some form of 
preliminary instructions because they feel it assists jurors in understanding their 
responsibility and the order of trial proceedings. 
Care should be taken to ensure that all parties are present during these and all jury 


instructions unless the record shows a waiver. This practice has been approved by the 


"appellate courts in Bradham v. State, 148 Ga. App. 89[6] [1978], even in the absence of the "
"defendant, Oliver v. State, 168 Ga. App. 477[4] at 478 [1983].) "


00.010 Generally 


"Members of the jury, the case you are about to try is styled . Under our legal "





"system, it is my duty as the trial judge to determine the law applicable to this case, and it is "
"your duty, as the jury, to determine the facts of the case. It is also your duty to apply the law "


to those facts in reaching your verdict. 


00.020 Evidence 

"You determine the facts from the evidence, which consists of two things: testimony and "
exhibits. Testimony is the statements that you will hear made under oath from the witness(es). 
"Exhibits are documents, photos, or other items that will be admitted into evidence. You will "
then have those exhibits with you in the jury room for use during your deliberations. 

I caution you that what the lawyers say during this trial is not evidence. Nothing they 
say in their opening statements or their arguments or at any other time during this trial is 
evidence. Nor is anything I might do or say evidence in this case. 

I have no leanings in this case whatsoever. My interest in this case is to see that it is 
tried fairly for both parties and to see that it is tried according to the laws of the State of 


Georgia and according to the constitutions of this state and of the United States. 


00.030 Parties (Optional) 
You must consider this case as a lawsuit between persons of equal worth and equal standing 
in the community and between persons holding the same or similar positions in life. All 
"persons stand equal before the law, and all persons are to be dealt with as equals in a court "
of justice. 

(Use the following when either the plaintiff or the defendant is a corporation.) 


"A business entity such as a corporation, like , is regarded as a person "





in this instance. 


O.C.G.A. 1-3-3(14) 


2 Updated July 2014 Preliminary General Instructions 


00.040 Burden of Proof 
"In a civil case such as this, the plaintiff has the burden of proving his/her case. The plaintiff "
must prove this case by what is known as a “preponderance of the evidence.” 

"The term “preponderance” means “greater weight,” and as it is used here, "
“preponderance of the evidence” means “the greater weight of evidence upon the issues 
involved.” The weight of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a 
"reasonable doubt. However, to be a preponderance, the weight of the evidence must be "
sufficient to incline a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to 
the other. 

(Give the following portion of this charge if an affirmative defense is asserted: 

The defendant has filed what is/are known as [an] affirmative defense[s] to the 


"claim[s] of the plaintiff, specifically [state the affirmative defense(s) asserted]. As to "





"that/those defense[s], the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of "
the evidence.) 
"If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it would then "
be your duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue. 
"(Note: The preceding paragraph has been disapproved by Dyer v. Souther, 274 Ga. "
61 [2001].) 


00.050 Credibility of Witnesses 
"The jury must determine the credibility, or believability, of the witnesses. Therefore, you "
"must determine which witness or witnesses you will believe and which you will not believe, "
if there are any whom you do not believe. 

In determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies and the credibility of 


"witnesses, you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case. You may consider "


"1) the witnesses’ manner of testifying, "

"2) their intelligence, "

"3) their means and opportunity for knowing the facts about which they testify, "
"4) the nature of the facts about which they testify, "


"5) the probability or improbability of their testimony, "


Preliminary General Instructions Updated July 2014 


"6) their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and "


7) their personal credibility as it appears from the trial. 


It is your duty to determine what testimony is worthy of belief and what testimony 
is not worthy of belief. You may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of 
any witness. 

"You may also consider the number of witnesses, but the preponderance of evidence "


does not necessarily lie with the party who has the greater number of witnesses. 


"O.C.G.A. §§24-14-4, 24-6-620 "


00.070 Rules of Evidence 

"The object of all legal investigation is the discovery of truth, and rules of evidence are "
designed with that one prominent purpose in mind. During the course of this trial there may 
be objections made by the lawyers and rulings made by the court. These objections and 
"rulings will involve the technical rules of evidence, and you should draw no inferences and "
make no assumptions from either the lawyer’s objections or the court’s rulings. Evidence 


that is not admitted because of an objection or other reason shall not be considered by you. 


00.080 Trial Procedure 
The procedure used in a civil trial is generally as follows: 

"First, the attorney for each side has the opportunity to address you in what is called "
an opening statement. This opening statement itself is not evidence. Remember that what the 
lawyers say is not evidence but rather is a preview or outline of what they expect the 
"evidence to be. Since the plaintiff has the burden of proof, the plaintiff goes first. "

"Following the opening statements, the plaintiff presents evidence; that is, the plaintiff "
calls witnesses and introduces any exhibits. The defendant has the right to cross-examine 
"these witnesses. When the plaintiff has presented all of his/her evidence, the plaintiff will "
rest his/her case. 

"The defendant then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means that the "
defendant then calls witnesses and introduces exhibits. The plaintiff has the right to cross- 


examine the defendant’s witnesses. 


4 Updated July 2014 Preliminary General Instructions 


"After all of the evidence has been presented, the attorneys have the opportunity to "
"make what is called a closing argument or a summation. At that time, the attorneys will "
attempt to point out to you certain parts of the evidence that they think are favorable to their 
position and try to persuade you to decide the case in their favor. Both sides have the 
opportunity to make this closing argument. 

"Following the closing arguments, I will charge you more specifically on the law "
directly applicable to this case. I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and 
reach your verdict. 

Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the 
"evidence. Do not jump to conclusions before all of the evidence is presented. Also, please "
"remember that during the course of this trial, it would be improper for you to discuss this "
case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the case with you or in your presence or 
hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in the jury room or elsewhere before 


"actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence of all twelve of you. "


00.090 Note Taking by Jurors 

Regarding juror note taking: I have asked the bailiff to provide you with pencils and note 
"pads for your use during trial. You may take notes, but you are not required to do so. If you "
"decide to take notes, please remember that note taking should not divert you from paying "
full attention to the evidence and evaluating witness credibility. Your observations of the 
witnesses during their testimony can be vital to your determination of the believability of 
their testimony. The notes that you take are for your use only and are not to be shared with 
"anyone until you begin deliberation with your fellow jurors. Notes are not evidence, only "
"memory aids, and should not take precedence over your recollection. It is the duty of each "
"juror to recall the evidence, and while you may consider another juror’s notes to refresh your "
"memory, you should rely on your own recollection of the proceedings. Do not be influenced "
"by the notes of other jurors, unless their notes help you in determining your own "
independent recollection. Notes are not entitled to any greater weight than the recollection or 
"impression of each juror as to what the evidence may have been. After the trial is over, the "


notes will be collected and destroyed.

"Potts v. State, 259 Ga. 96 (1989) "


00.100 Concluding Remarks 
"I instruct you, ladies and gentlemen, that you must decide this case for yourself solely on the "
testimony you hear from the witness stand and the exhibits admitted into evidence. You may 
not visit any scenes depicted by the evidence. You may not utilize any books or documents 
not in evidence during your deliberations. You may not read or listen to any accounts of the 
"trial that might appear in the news media. You may not discuss this case with anyone, "
"including your fellow jurors, until the court authorizes you to do so. "

"That concludes my preliminary instructions, and we are now ready for the lawyers to "


give their opening statements.

00.110 Juror Use of Electronic Technology to Conduct Research on or 
Communicate about a Case 
(Before Trial: ) 

"To preserve the integrity of the jury system, you as finders of facts must decide this "
"case solely upon evidence presented in this courtroom. This means that during the trial, you "
"must not conduct any independent research about this case, the matters in the case, and the "
"individuals or corporations involved in the case. In other words, you should not consult "
"dictionaries or reference materials; search the Internet, websites, or blogs; or use any other "
electronic tools to obtain information about this case or to help you decide the case. Please 
do not try to find out information from any source outside the confines of this courtroom— 
"to include media of any sort or online legal research. Until you retire to deliberate, you may "
"not discuss this case with anyone, even your fellow jurors. After you retire to deliberate, you "
"may begin discussing the case with your fellow jurors, but you cannot discuss the case with "
anyone else until you have returned a verdict and the case is at an end. I hope that for all of 
"you this case is interesting and noteworthy. I know that many of you use cell phones, "
"Blackberries, the Internet, and other tools of technology. You also must not talk to anyone "
about this case or use these tools to communicate electronically with anyone about the case. 
This includes your family and friends. You may not communicate with anyone about the 
"case on your cell phone, through e-mail, Blackberry, iPhone, text messaging, or on Twitter; "
through any blog or website; through any Internet chat room; or by way of any other social 


"networking websites, including Facebook, My Space, LinkedIn, and YouTube. "


(At the Close of the Case:) 

"During your deliberations, you must not communicate with or provide any "
information to anyone by any means about this case. You may not use any electronic device 
"or media, such as a telephone, cell phone, smart phone, iPhone, Blackberry, or computer; the "
"Internet, any Internet service, or any text or instant messaging service; or any Internet chat "
"room, blog, or website such as Facebook, My Space, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Twitter to "
communicate to anyone any information about this case or to conduct any research about 


this case until I accept your verdict.

plaintiff must prove his/her case by what is known as a preponderance of the evidence; that

reasonable doubt.’’) 

Clear and convincing evidence is defined as evidence that will cause the jury to firmly 
believe each essential element of the claim to a high degree of probability. Proof by clear and 
convincing evidence requires a level of proof greater than a preponderance of the evidence (but 


less than beyond a reasonable doubt). (Give definition of reasonable doubt if appropriate.)

"02.100 Evidence, Generally "
Evidence is the means by which any fact that is put in question is established or disproved. 

Evidence includes all of the testimony of the witnesses as well as the exhibits 
"admitted during the trial. (It also includes any stipulations, which are facts agreed to by the "
attorneys.) 

Evidence may be either direct or circumstantial or both. 

"In considering the evidence, you may use reasoning and common sense to make "
deductions and reach conclusions. “Direct evidence” is the testimony of a person who 
asserts that he or she has actual knowledge of a fact (such as an eyewitness) (such as by 
personally observing or otherwise witnessing that fact). “Circumstantial evidence” is proof 
of [a chain or set of] facts and/or circumstances that tend to prove or disprove another fact 
"by inference (that is, by consistency with such fact or elimination of other facts). There is no "
legal difference in the weight you may give to either direct or circumstantial evidence. 


"(Adapted from 11th Circuit PJI, p. 21) "


"02.110 Evidence, Direct or Circumstantial "
(Use if appropriate.) 


Direct evidence is evidence that immediately points to the question at issue. 


General Instructions Updated January 2020 


Circumstantial (or indirect) evidence is evidence that only tends to establish a fact; it 
must be such as to reasonably establish that fact rather than anything else. The comparative 
weight of circumstantial and direct evidence on any given issue is a question of fact for you 


to decide. 


"Scott v. State, 57 Ga. App. 489 (1938) "
O.C.G.A. §24-14-6 


(The following are alternative charges as to evidence.) 

Direct evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts to 
"which the witness testifies and that, if believed, is sufficient to prove or establish these facts. "

Circumstantial evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts 
"to which the witness testifies, from which such facts, if believed, you may find other facts to "
"exist, that are reasonable and believable to you in the light of your experience. "

"When circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish a fact or theory, it must be "


such as to reasonably establish that fact or theory rather than anything else.

The parties have entered into a stipulation that has been approved by the court about the 


"following (facts) (testimony, documents, exhibits): "

"Where parties stipulate facts with the approval of the court, this is in the nature of evidence. "

02.114 Judicial Notice 

"(Spoliation, see Hillman v. Aldi, Inc., 349 Ga. App. 432 (2019)) "

I have taken judicial notice of certain facts or events. When the Court declares that it has 
"taken judicial notice of some fact or event, you must accept the Court’s declaration as "


conclusive evidence and regard as proved the fact or event that has been judicially noticed.

02.116 Limiting Instructions 

Sometimes evidence is admitted (for a limited purpose) or (against some parties and not 
others). Such evidence may be considered by the jury for the sole issue or purpose (against 
that/those party(ies)) for which the evidence is limited and not for any other purpose. 

(Note: “[A]lthough a trial judge is not required in the absence of a request to give a 
"limiting instruction when . . . evidence [or related acts] is admitted, it would be better for the "
"trial judge to do so.” State v. Belt, 269 Ga. 763 (1998). The charge should be given prior to "
"the admission of such evidence and repeated in the final charge. Chisholm v. State, 231 Ga. "
App. 835 (1998).) 

"Note: NEW code section requires the judge to give limiting instructions, when "
"applicable, ON REQUEST. Probably better to give, if applicable, whether requested or not. "

02.118 Limiting Instructions/ Conditional Admissibility 
"Sometimes evidence is admitted conditionally; that is, although you have been permitted to "
"hear the evidence, it is only admitted and you may only consider it if you also find certain "
required but disputed predicate facts which allow you to consider such evidence. 

If you do not find the conditions necessary in order to allow you to consider the 
"evidence, then you must disregard it completely even though you have heard the evidence. "

02.120 Expert Witnesses 

(Use only if applicable.) 

Testimony has been given in this case by certain witnesses who are termed experts. Expert 
witnesses are those who because of their training and experience possess knowledge in a 
particular field that is not common knowledge or known to the average citizen. The law 


permits expert witnesses to give their opinions based upon that training and experience. 


General Instructions Updated January 2020 


"You are not required to accept the testimony of any witnesses, expert or otherwise. "
"Testimony of an expert, like that of all witnesses, is to be given only such weight and credit "


as you think it is properly entitled to receive.

"When scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge might be helpful, a person "
who has special training or experience in that field is allowed to state an opinion about the 
matter. But that does not mean you must accept the witness’s opinion. As with any other 
"witness’s testimony, you must decide for yourself whether to rely upon the opinion. "

02.130 Credibility of Witnesses 
*Note: The committee removed “Intelligence” as a credibility factor from the criminal 
"charge on credibility of witnesses based on McKenzie v. State, 293 Ga. App. 350 (2) (2008); "
"however, the Federal Rules re-codify it. O.C.G.A. §24-14-4. Query: What if the defense "
brings in a world-renowned DNA expert who is a certified genius to testify versus a seeming 
"bureaucratic “expert for the state,” and the defense requests the charge including "
intelligence? The cases prohibiting the use of “intelligence” in charge are a seeming 
egalitarian knee-jerk against correlating intelligence and honesty. But credibility also may 
depend on competency. The charge is neutrally drawn and can be adequately argued by 
either side. 

"The jury must determine the credibility of the witnesses. In deciding this, you may "
"consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the witnesses’ manner of "
"testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts about which "


"they testify, the nature of the facts about which they testify, the probability or improbability "

Your assessment of a trial witness's credibility may be affected by comparing or contrasting 
that testimony to statements or testimony of that same witness before the trial started. It is 
for you to decide whether there is a reasonable explanation for any inconsistency in a 
witness's pre-trial statements and testimony when compared to the same witness's trial 
"testimony. As with all issues of witness credibility, you the jury must apply your common "

02.500 Verdict; Form of 

(Note: The following verdict form will suffice in most cases. Cases involving multiple parties 
and special issues may require different verdict forms. These verdict forms and any 
stipulations should be discussed with attorneys at pretrial.) 

If you believe from (a preponderance of the evidence) (clear and convincing 
"evidence) that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, you would find for the plaintiff "
"and the form of your verdict would be, “We, the jury, find for the plaintiff in the sum of "
"(blank) dollars.” (Where I have used the word “blank,” you would insert such sum in dollars "
and cents as you think the plaintiff is entitled to recover.) 

If you do not think the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages based upon the 
"evidence presented, you should find for the defendant, and the form of your verdict would "


"be, “We, the jury, find for the defendant.” "


02.510 Verdict; Quotient

"If you find for the plaintiff, then you must determine an amount to be awarded to the "

members after the amount is determined. 

It is unlawful for you to agree in advance to be bound by the figure that is calculated 
by each of you writing down your own figure and then adding them together and dividing 
the sum by twelve. If you wish to use this method to arrive at an amount for discussion 
"without binding yourself in advance to accept the result, you may do so. You are not "
prohibited from accepting that result and adopting it as your verdict after the amount is 
determined if you believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the figure arrived at by 
"this method represents just and adequate damages. However, you must have first found in "
"favor of the plaintiff, and you must all agree after the amount has been determined that the "


amount represents your verdict.

"one of your number to act as foreperson, who will preside over your deliberations and who "
will sign the verdict to which all twelve of you freely and voluntarily agree. 

You should start your deliberations with an open mind. You should carefully 
consider all of the evidence in the case and deliberate with an aim toward reaching a 
"unanimous verdict consistent with your consciences and oaths as jurors. Avoid premature, "
fixed opinions. Consult with one another and consider each other’s views. Each of you must 
"decide this case for yourself, but you should do so only after discussion and consideration of "

Your verdict must be unanimous. You have been deliberating this case for a considerable 
"length of time, and the court deems it proper to advise you further in regard to the "
desirability of agreement if possible. 

The case has been exhaustively and carefully tried by both sides. It has been 
"submitted to you for decision and verdict, if possible, rather than for disagreement. It is the "
law that a unanimous verdict is required. While this verdict must be the conclusion of each 
"juror and not a mere acquiescence in order to reach an agreement, it is still necessary for all "
the jurors to examine the issues and questions submitted with candor and fairness and with a 
"proper regard for, and deference to, the opinion of the others. "

Each juror should listen to the arguments of other jurors with a disposition to be 
"convinced by them. If you differ in your views of the evidence, such difference of opinion "
should cause you to scrutinize the evidence more closely and to reexamine the grounds of 
your opinions. 

"Your duty is to decide the issues of fact that have been submitted to you, if you can "
"do so conscientiously. In conferring, you should lay aside all mere pride of opinion and "
should bear in mind that the jury room is no place to champion either side of a cause. As 
"jurors, you should not be advocates. The aim to keep in mind is the truth as it appears from "

with the statement that it is in full payment of all demands against the maker and the creditor 
"accepts the check, cashes it, and retains the money, there is a valid accord and satisfaction, "
"even if the creditor, at the time of receiving the check, protests to the debtor that it is not "


accepted as full payment but only as a credit on the account. 


04.042 Accord and Satisfaction; Uncashed Check 

When a check is tendered and delivered to a creditor for a stated amount as full and 
"complete satisfaction of a claim and the check is retained by the creditor, whether the "
"amount of the claim is established or uncertain, the following rule of law applies: If the "
"creditor does not cash or deposit the check, it does not amount to an accord and satisfaction "
"of the claim as a matter of law, but it is a question of fact. This rule applies unless the "
creditor acknowledges receipt and retention of the check for the purpose tendered; in which 


"case, it does amount to an accord and satisfaction. "

We have been trying what is known as a condemnation case between ; 





"Plaintiff (Condemnor), and , Defendant (Owner or Condemnee). "





The lawsuit the plaintiff has filed for this purpose is called the complaint. It says in 


substance that plaintiff has taken (title to) (an easement for purpose over) a 





"described tract of defendant’ s land (and, if applicable, in a highway condemnation), together "

"Under the law and under the constitution of this state, plaintiff has the right to take (or "

"compensation for the property taken. The only question is, “What constitutes just and "
"adequate compensation for the property taken?” By “property,” I mean all property rights of "
"any kind. Property rights are determined as of the date plaintiff condemned the rights, which "


is (the date the condemning authority tenders or pays the money).

evidence what amount of money constitutes just and adequate compensation for the property 
"taken. While the burden of proof is upon the condemning authority, the owner of the "
"property is also allowed to offer evidence upon the issues involved, and you must determine "


the issues in the case by the preponderance of the evidence as you find it to be.

14.140 Condemnation; Consequential Damages for Property Not Taken 
Consequential damage to the owner’s property not taken is generally determined by figuring 
the difference between the value of the remaining property immediately before the taking 
and its value after the taking for a particular proposed improvement. This measure of 
consequential damages should be made as of the date of taking. Another way of stating the 
proper measure of consequential damages to the remainder of the owner’s property is the 
"decrease, if any, in the fair market value of this remainder in its circumstance just prior to "
the time of the taking compared with its fair market value in its new circumstance just after 


the time of the taking.

"In determining the amount of consequential damages, if any, you should consider "
"whether the condemnation will benefit the land the owner has left and, if so, reduce the "
consequential damage by that amount. The reduced amount is the consequential damage. 
"However, consequential benefits must be disregarded to the extent that they exceed "
"consequential damages; that is, consequential benefits to the remaining property may be "
"shown only as an offset against consequential damages, not as an offset against the value of "


land actually taken or used.

The benefits that can offset against or reduce consequential damage are what the law calls 
special benefits rather than general benefits. A special benefit would be something that adds 
"to the convenience, accessibility, or usefulness of the property affected by the "
condemnation. It could benefit the properties of other individuals and still be a special 
benefit within the meaning of condemnation law. Examples of general benefits that you 
"would not consider would be increased general prosperity, value, beautifying the "

O.C.G.A. §32-1-3 


14.310 Condemnation; Limited-Access Road; Deprivation of Access Rights 
A limited-access highway is a special kind of highway provided for by law. A person 


ordinarily has the right of access to a public road or highway that goes through the person’s 


8 Updated August 2020 Condemnation 


"property; that is, the right to go on or off the highway from or to the property, which is a "
property right and for which the person is entitled to be paid if a condemnation takes away 
"that right. These rights do not pertain to limited-access highways, and the owner is not "
entitled to such payments for the lack or absence of access rights. 

(The next provision refers to interference with access to an existing road or highway 
and should be charged only if applicable to the facts.) 

If the construction of a limited-access highway interferes with the owner’s access 
"right, the owner’s right of access to an existing road would have to be taken into account, "


"condemned, and included in the owner’s compensation for land actually taken. "


14.400 Condemnation; Leased Property 

"In determining the damages for the condemnation of land that is being leased, you would "
"need to determine both the amount of damages to the lessor (that is, the owner) and to the "
"lessee (that is, the person it is being leased to). Ordinarily, the total amount of such damage "
would not exceed the total fair market value of the land. The measure of damages to the 
lessee (the person it is being leased to) would ordinarily be the market value of the lease to 
"the lessee (the person leasing it), less the amount of rent payable under the lease. The "
remaining value of the lease to the lessor (owner) would ordinarily be its rental value to 
"him/her/it for the period of the lease, plus the value of the reversion or the value of "
his/her/its future interest after the lease has ended. 

"If there are special damages, such as loss of profits and business or expenses for "
"removal of business or other matters that would make the fair market value test inadequate, "
you would consider these matters in addition to the fair market value of the land in 
determining what is just and adequate compensation for the lessor and the lessee. 

Business losses are recoverable as a separate item of damages only if you believe 


from the evidence that the property involved is unique.

16.000 CONTRACTS 


16.010 Contracts; Definition 
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties for the doing or not doing of some 


specified thing. 


O.C.G.A. §13-1-1 


16.020 Contracts; Essentials 
"To constitute a lawful contract, there must be parties able to contract, a consideration for the "
"contract, the agreement of the parties to the terms of the contract, and a lawful subject "


matter. 
O.C.G.A. §13-3-1 


A consideration is valid if any person who promised is entitled to a benefit or any 
harm is done to one who receives the promise. 

(Considerations are distinguished as good and valuable. A good consideration is 
founded on natural duty and affection or on a strong moral obligation. A valuable 
consideration is founded on money or something convertible into money or has a value in 


money. Marriage is also a valuable consideration.) 
"O.C.G.A. §§13-3-41, 13-3-42 "


"(See O.C.G.A. §13-3-44, Promissory Estoppel.) "


16.030 Contracts; Assent; Generally 
"The consent of the parties is essential to the validity or enforcement of a contract, and until "
"both parties have agreed to all its terms, there is no contract. Until the contract is agreed to, a "


party may withdraw an offer or bid or proposition. 


O.C.G.A. §13-3-2 


16.040 Contracts; Assent; Letters and Replies 

"If the offer is made by mail, the acceptance by written reply takes effect from the time it is "
mailed and not from the time it is received; the offeror cannot withdraw in the meantime. If 
"the offer contains different terms, the party receiving the offer has the right to choose which "


"terms will be accepted, and the sending party will be bound by such choice. "


O.C.G.A. §13-3-3 


16.050 Contracts; Assent; Sales of Goods 
"(For applicability of this charge, see definition of goods in O.C.G.A. §11-2-105.) "

"As to sales of goods, unless otherwise clearly indicated by the language or "
"circumstances, an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any "
manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances. A definite and reasonable 
expression of acceptance or a written confirmation that is sent within a reasonable time 
"operates as an acceptance, even though it states terms additional to or different from those "
"offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional upon assent to the "
additional or different terms. The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for 
addition to the contract. 

Conduct by both parties that recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to 
"establish a contract for sale, but the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a "
"contract. In such case, the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms to which the "
"writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary provisions incorporated under "


any other terms of the Uniform Commercial Code. 


"O.C.G.A. §§11-2-206, 11-2-207 "


16.060 Contracts; Novation 

A new contract as to the same matter and with no new consideration does not destroy the 
"original contract between the same parties. However, if new parties are introduced by "
"novation so as to change the person to whom the obligation is due, the original contract is at "
an end. 


A novation has four essential elements: 


2 Contracts 


"1) previous valid obligation, "
"2) agreement of all parties to new contract, "
"3) cancellation of old contract, and "


4) validity of new contract.

"Williams v. Rowe, 205 Ga. 770 (1949) "


16.100 Contracts; Temporary Departure; Generally 

When parties in the performance of a contract depart from its terms and pay or receive 
money under such departure before either party can recover for failure to carry out the exact 
"terms of the agreement, reasonable notice must be given to the other party of intention to "
rely on the exact terms of the agreement. The original contract will be suspended by the 
departure until such notice. 

"In order for this rule to have application, it is necessary that the circumstances be "
"such as will in law imply a mutual new agreement whereby new, distinct, and definite terms "
are supplied in lieu of those provided for by the original contract. The departure from the 
terms of the contract must have been substantial and such as to make it inequitable for the 
creditor to demand without previous notice all past-due payments or to proceed to collect by 
"suit. Evidence of the buyer’s repeated, late, irregular payments, which were accepted by the "
"person to whom payment was due, is a factor for your consideration in determining whether "


anew mutual agreement is to be implied.

"16.200 Contracts; Good Faith Performance, Duty of "

"As a general rule, there is implied in every contract for work or services a duty to perform it "
skillfully and carefully. The law requires persons undertaking to perform services requiring 
"skill the duty to use that reasonable degree of care, skill, and ability that would be used "


under similar conditions and circumstances by others of the same business or profession.

"In some circumstances, a party to a contract may be relieved from the duties and "
"responsibilities of the contract upon the happening of an accident. The accident, to be a "


"sufficient occurrence, must meet the following three requirements: "


4 Contracts 


1) It must not be the result of the negligence or misconduct of the party seeking relief; 

2) It must not have been anticipated by the parties at the time the contract was entered 
into; and 

3) The result of the accident must be that one of the parties has gained an undue 


advantage over the other in a court of law.

16.300 Contracts; Mistake; Definition; Degree of Proof 
"A mistake, in order to be worthy of relief, should be some unintentional act, omission, or "
"error arising from ignorance, surprise, imposition, or misplaced confidence. "

Mistake may be either of law or of fact. 

"The power to relieve mistakes shall be exercised with caution; to justify it, the "
"evidence shall be clear, unequivocal, and decisive as to the mistake. "


A relievable mistake must be in reference to a material present or past fact.

16.310 Contracts; Mistake of Law 
An honest mistake of the law as to the effect of an instrument on the part of both contracting 
"parties, when such mistake operates as a great injustice to one and gives an unconscionable "
"advantage to the owner, may be relieved. "

A mutual mistake of law is a good defense against an action to recover money under 
a contract when there is full knowledge of all the facts but the parties have acted under a 
"misapprehension of the law as applied to those facts, provided the mistake is clearly proved "
and the plaintiff could not in good conscience have received the money sued for. This 


principle applies to reformation of documents.

16.600 Contracts; Account 
(See 16.610—16.650. ) 


16.610 Contracts; Account; Definition 
An account is a business relation in which goods (and/or services) are furnished upon credit 


by one party at the request of another party. 


16.620 Contracts; Account; Defendant Must Authorize Account 
"In order to recover upon account, the plaintiff must prove that the goods (services) were "
furnished for the defendant’s account at the request of the defendant or by someone 
authorized by the defendant to make such a request. 

If goods (services) were furnished at the request of someone other than the 
"defendant, and it was not intended that a credit relationship exist between the plaintiff and "


"the defendant, you would find against the plaintiff and for the defendant. "


16.630 Contracts; Account; Plaintiff Must Prove Correctness 
"In order to recover damages, the plaintiff must prove the correct amount due and unpaid on "


the account. 


16.640 Contracts; Account Stated 
An account stated is an agreement by which persons who have had previous transactions 
with each other fix the amount due in respect to such transactions by mutual agreement and 


the one indebted promises payment of the balance. 


Contracts 


"Moore v. Hendrix &amp; Hodges, 144 Ga. 646, 648 (1916) "


"In order to convert an open account into an account stated, an oral agreement as to "


the amount and an oral promise to pay are sufficient. 


"Martin v. Mayer, 63 Ga. App. 387, 399 (1940) "


16.650 Contracts; Account Stated by Implication 
An account may become stated even without express agreement. If a statement of an account 
"is rendered to the debtor and the debtor fails to object to it, the jury may be authorized to "
infer that the failure to raise any objections was an implied agreement that the account was 
"correct, but this inference is not demanded as a matter of law. "

"A promise to pay may be either express or implied, but a failure to object to an "
account rendered does not require the jury to infer a promise to pay from mere acquiescence 


in the correctness of the amount. 
"Shores-Mueller Company v. Bell, 21 Ga. App. 194, 195 (1917) "


"While such a failure to object may be considered by the jury, it is not to be regarded "
"as final proof but only a means of proof having evidentiary value, and it is subject to "


explanation and denial by other evidence. 
"Elliott v. National Union Radio Corporation, 68 Ga. App. 873, 876 (1943) "


"Whether any explanation or denial is sufficient is a matter for the jury to determine, "
keeping in mind that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. The jury may find that the failure 
of the defendant to object within a reasonable time to a statement of account shifts to the 
defendant the burden of going forward with the evidence or an unfavorable inference may 
be made regarding the defendant’s testimony. No inference would be drawn from the 
rendering of a statement of account by the plaintiff if the defendant gave timely objections to 
any inaccuracies found in the statement or if the defendant has satisfactorily explained the 
failure to so object. 

"If you find that there has been no acknowledgment and oral promise to pay, either "


"expressed or implied, the rules relating to an account stated simply would not apply, and you "


10 Contracts 


"would then resolve the issue based upon the rule that in order to recover, the plaintiff must "


prove the correctness of the account and the liability of the defendant to pay it. 
"Lawson v. Dixie Feed and Seed Company Inc., 112 Ga. App. 562 (1965) "


"(Note: For rules concerning Statute of Limitation on Open Accounts, see O.C.G.A. "

16.700 Contracts; Quantum Meruit 
(See 16.710-16.760.) 


16.710 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Statutory Provision 
"Ordinarily, when one renders services or transfers property valuable to another that the other "
"accepts, a promise is implied to pay the reasonable value of the services or property (but this "


presumption does not usually arise in cases between very near relatives). 
O.C.G.A. §9-2-7 


"(See O.C.G.A. $10-6-37, Suit for Breach of Contract of Agency; §53-12-90, Trusts "
"Implied, When; and §53-12-92, Gift Presumed Between Near Relatives; Rebuttal of "


Presumption.) 


16.720 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Definition 

"Quantum meruit, meaning “as much as a person deserves,” is an action for work and labor "
founded on an implied promise on the part of the defendant to pay the plaintiff as much as is 
reasonably deserved for labor performed. It refers to obligations imposed by law without 


regard to intention or assent of the parties dictated by reason and justice. 


16.730 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Amount of Recovery 
The amount of recovery is determined by the jury based upon the reasonable value of the 
services rendered to the opposite party despite of the absence of a specific agreement as 


to value. 


Contracts 11 


16.740 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Not Applicable Where Express 

Contract Exists 
"When an express contract between the parties exists, then the value of such services and "
"other terms will be set by it, and the plaintiff would not be authorized to recover on quantum "
"meruit, unless you find that the plaintiff performed services not contemplated by the parties "


in the original written contract. 


"Venture Construction Company v. Great American Mortgage Investors, 134 Ga. App. "
"440, 444 (1975) "
"Rushing v. Jones, 68 Ga. App. 300 (1942) "


Recovery may be authorized in guantum meruit when a party receives benefits in 


part performance that exceed damages incurred by failure of full performance. 


"Southern Railway Company v. Branil, 9 Ga. App. 310, 312 (1911) "


16.750 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Essential Requisites for Recovery 

"In order for the plaintiff to recover, the plaintiff must show that he/she had such a "
"relationship with the defendant as to authorize the plaintiff to render the services alleged, "
"that valuable services were rendered, that such services were accepted, that they benefited "
"the defendant, and that they had a reasonable value. The value of the services must be "


proved by a preponderance of the evidence. 


"Davis v. Glenville Haldi, P.C., 148 Ga. App. 842 (1979) "
"Parker and Company Inc. v. Glenn, 90 Ga. App. 500, 506 (1954) "


16.760 Contracts; Quantum Meruit; Circumstances between Near Relatives for 
Jury to Determine 

In order for a party to recover for services from a near relative such as are usually given 

"because of a natural sense of duty and affection arising out of relation, it must affirmatively "

"appear that such services were performed under an express contract, or the surrounding "

circumstances must plainly indicate that it was the intention of both parties that 


compensation would be made. 


12 Contracts 


It is a question for the jury to determine what circumstances are sufficient to support 
the usual implication of a promise to pay for services or to repeal a counterinference that the 
performance was prompted by affection and that the services were rendered without 


expectation of payment. 
"Edwards v. Smith, 42 Ga. App. 730 (1931) "


(Note: The theory of recovery involved in quantum meruit should be distinguished 
from actions for money or property that in equity and good conscience there is no right to 


retain against another with a legitimate interest therein.)

valebant situations for goods sold and delivered.) 


16.800 Contracts; Rescission 


(See 16.810-16.830.) 


16.810 Contracts; Rescission; by Consent 
"After a contract is made, neither party to such contract can rescind it merely by giving notice "
"to the other party of the intention to do so without the agreement or consent of the other, but "


it may be rescinded with the consent of both parties. 


"Warren v. Gray, 90 Ga. App. 398, 404 (1954) "


16.820 Contracts; Rescission; for Nonperformance

nonperformance of covenants but only when both parties can be restored to the condition 


they were in before the contract was made.

18.000 CONTRACT DAMAGES 


18.010 Contract Damages 
Damages are given as compensation for injury sustained. 

Damages recoverable for a breach of contract are such as arise naturally and 
according to the usual course of things from the breach and such as the parties contemplated 


when the contract was made as the probable result of the breach. 


"O.C.G.A. §§13-6-1, 13-6-2, 13-6-7 "


18.011 Contract Damages; Agreement

"liquidated, and unless the agreement violates some principle of law, the parties are bound "


by it. 


O.C.G.A. §13-6-7 


18.012 Contract Damages; Nominal Damages 
"In every case of breach of contract, the party not breaching it has a right to damages. But, if "
"there has been no actual damage, the plaintiff can recover nominal damages that will carry "


expenses of litigation. 


"O.C.G.A. §§13-6-6, 13-6-12 "


18.020 Contract Damages; Attorney’s Fees (Expenses of Litigation); Generally 
"The expenses of litigation are not generally allowed as a part of the damages. But, if the "
defendant has acted in bad faith or has been stubbornly litigious or has caused the plaintiff 
"unnecessary trouble and expense, you may allow them. You should determine from the "


"evidence the attorney’s fees (or other expense), if any, as will be allowed. "

on contracts.

18.030 Contract Damages; Remote or Consequential 

Remote or consequential damages are not allowed whenever they cannot be traced solely to 
"the breach of the contract or unless they may be computed exactly, such as the profits that "
are the immediate fruit of the contract and are independent of any collateral enterprises 


entered into in contemplation of the contract. 


O.C.G.A. §13-6-8 


18.040 Contract Damages; Interest 
The amount of damages at the date of breach of contract may be increased by the addition of 
legal interest from that time until the time of recovery. 

"All liquidated demands, whether by agreement or otherwise the sum to be paid is "
"fixed and certain, bear interest from the time the party shall become liable and bound to pay "
"them; if payable on demand, they bear interest from the time of the demand. In case of "
"promissory notes payable on demand, the law presumes a demand instantly and gives "


interest from date.

"Upon a breach of covenant of warranty of title to land, the damages should be the purchase "
"money with interest from the time of sale, unless the jury should think, under the "
"circumstances of the case, that the use of the premises was equal to the interest on the "
money and that an equitable setoff should be allowed. If valuable improvements have been

may recover as damages for any nonconformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary 
course of events from the seller’s breach as determined in any manner that is reasonable. 
The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and 
place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value the goods would 
"have been if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate "
damages of a different amount. 
"In a proper case, any incidental and consequential damages under the next section "


may also be recovered. 
O.C.G.A. §11-2-714

This preliminary charge 22.001 and the general charge 22.005 et al. are specifically 
adapted for use in domestic cases. We have included cross-references to the civil charge 
book to facilitate incorporation of other standard charges as appropriate. 

"For cases that do not involve child support, charge the appropriate parts of Sections 22.000 "
"only. For cases involving child support, charge the appropriate charges of Section 22.000 et "
al. and then charge the appropriate charges from Section 23.000 et al. Consider a jury trial 
procedure where assets and alimony are decided first because those verdicts may impact the 
"jury’s decision on child support issues. However, where periodic alimony is being requested "
"and child support is an issue, it makes sense for the jury to determine child support first, so "

they know much of the obligor’s income is available to satisfy a periodic alimony award. A 


suggested trial procedure is listed below.

22.001 Divorce (Child Support); Preliminary Instructions 
(Read before commencement of trial.) 
"Members of the jury, you are about to try the case of "


DA . You will be 








deciding whether (is/are) entitled to a divorce (note: this may not be 
an issue if both parties agree to the divorce in the complaint and counterclaim). You will 
(also) be deciding issues incidental to divorce such as equitable division of property (and 
"alimony) (and child support). Under Georgia law, it is my duty as the trial judge to "
"determine the law applicable to this case, and it is your duty, as the jury, to determine the "
facts of the case. It is also your duty to apply the law to those facts in reaching your verdict. 

The facts are determined by you from the evidence. The evidence consists of two 
things: testimony and exhibits. Testimony is evidence which you will hear under oath from 
the witness(es). Exhibits are documents or photos or other items that have been admitted into 
evidence. You will have those exhibits with you in the jury room for your use during your 
deliberations. 

I caution you that nothing the lawyers or I say during this trial is evidence. Nothing 
"the attorneys say in their opening statements, closing arguments, or during the trial is "


"evidence, nor is anything I do or say evidence. I have no leanings in this case whatsoever. "


"(At the beginning of the trial, you will be given various forms such as financial "


affidavits and child support calculation schedules of either or both parties. I instruct you that 


"2 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


these forms are not evidence but are the contentions of the parties in the format required by 
law. These forms are not to be considered by you as evidence until and unless and to the 
"extent they are supported by admissible evidence, such as by testimony or by other admitted "
"exhibits [or unless the figures of both parties coincide, which you may regard as a stipulation "


of fact]). 


My interest in this case is to see that the case is tried fairly as to both parties and to 
see that it is tried according to the laws of the State of Georgia and according to the 


Constitutions of this State and of the United States. 


00.030 Parties (Optional) 
"In a divorce case such as this, each party has a claim against the other. Each party has the "
burden of proving entitlement to that which he/she seeks. Each party must prove his/her 


respective case by what is known as a preponderance of the evidence. 


"The term preponderance means greater weight, and as it is used here, preponderance "
of the evidence means the greater weight of evidence upon the issues involved. The weight 
"of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a reasonable doubt, but to "

a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to the other. 


"If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it is your "
duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue. 

"The procedure followed in a divorce trial is generally as follows: First, the attorneys "
for both sides have the opportunity to make an opening statement to you. This opening 
statement is not evidence. Remember that what the lawyers say is not evidence. An opening 
statement is a preview or an outline of what they expect the evidence to show. Following the 
"opening statements, one party presents evidence; that is, one party calls witnesses and "
introduces any exhibits they may have. The other party has the right to cross-examine these 
"witnesses. When the first party has presented all his/her evidence, that party will rest his/her "
"case. The other party then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means they then "
call witnesses and introduce any exhibits. The first party has the right to cross-examine the 


second party’s witnesses. 


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 3 "


"After the presentation of all the evidence, the attorneys have the opportunity to make "
"a closing argument to you. At this time, the attorneys will point to certain evidence and law "
they consider favorable to their position and argue persuasively to you to decide the case in 
their favor. Both sides have the opportunity to make this closing argument. The closing 


arguments are not evidence. 


"Following the closing arguments, I will charge you on the law applicable to this case. "
I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and reach your verdict as to the 
issue(s) of (equitable division) (alimony). (You will decide child support in a second phase 


of the trial.) 


Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the 
evidence. Keep an open mind until all of the evidence has been presented to you. I instruct 
that it is improper for you to discuss this case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the 
case with you or in your presence or hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in 
"the jury room or elsewhere before actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence "
of all 12 of you. (After you have returned your verdict on the issue(s) of (equitable division 
"of property) (alimony), I will charge you further on the law pertaining to child support.) "
"Have no contact with the attorneys, parties, or witnesses to this case. Do not go on or about "


any areas described by the witnesses to this case.

22.005 Divorce; Introduction 


You have been considering the case of (enter name of plaintiff) as Plaintiff v. (enter name of 
"defendant) as Defendant, Civil Action No. (enter number). (One of the issues that you must "


decide in this case is whether or not is entitled to a divorce.) (The divorce 





"4 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


is agreed to by the parties and will be granted by the court upon the conclusion of the trial.) 
You will (also) be deciding issues incidental to divorce. Each party is seeking an equitable 
division of property (and Plaintiff/Defendant is/are seeking alimony). Each party has the 
burden of proof as to what he/she seeks. The party who has the burden of proof must prove 


his/her case by what is known as a preponderance of the evidence. 


"The term preponderance means greater weight, and as it is used here, preponderance "
of the evidence means the greater weight of evidence upon the issues involved. The weight 
"of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a reasonable doubt, but to "
"be a preponderance of the evidence, the weight of the evidence must be sufficient to incline "


a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to the other. 
"If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it is your "
duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue.

22.020 General Charge (Grounds) 


"The plaintiff in this case is seeking a divorce upon the grounds of. , which is "





a legal ground for divorce in Georgia. 

O.C.G.A. §19-5-3 (note that all grounds for divorce are listed in O.C.G.A. § 19-5-3 but 
only selected portions of the code have been included in the pattern jury instructions because 
they represent the most often cited grounds; refer to the code for other grounds as the facts 


of the case may indicate). 


22.025 Adultery 

Adultery after marriage by either party is a legal ground for divorce in Georgia. A married 
person commits adultery when he/she voluntarily has sexual intercourse with someone other 
than his/her spouse. 


O.C.G.A. 19-5-3 (6) 


22.030 Cruel Treatment 
Cruel treatment is a legal ground for divorce in Georgia. Cruel treatment is the willful 
"infliction of pain, bodily or mental, upon the complaining party such as reasonably justifies "
"apprehension of danger to life, limb, or health. "

O.C.G.A. §19-5-3(10) 

"Morris v. Morris, 202 Ga. 431 (1947) "


22.040 Cruel Treatment; Single Act 
"Ordinarily, a single act of personal violence is not considered cruel treatment, but one act "
may be sufficient to justify divorce on the ground of cruel treatment in a severe and

"Twilley v. Twilley, 195 Ga. 291 (1943) "


22.060 Condonation 
The plaintiff/defendant claims that any fault or misconduct on his/her part has been 
"condoned or forgiven by the defendant/plaintiff. Condonation is forgiveness, either express "
"or implied by a spouse, of a breach of marital duty on the part of the other spouse, with the "
implied condition that the offense shall not be repeated. New acts constituting grounds for 
divorce after condonation will revive the grounds for divorce that took place before the 
condonation. 
(Note: Charges 22.020 through 22.060 do not apply in irretrievably broken cases if

22.070 Irretrievably Broken Marriage 
One of the issues that you must decide is whether or not the plaintiff/defendant is entitled to 
a divorce. The plaintiff has claimed in the pleadings that he/she is entitled to a divorce on the 
"ground that the marriage is irretrievably broken, and this allegation has been denied by the "
defendant. 

"With regard to this issue, a marriage is irretrievably broken if either or both parties "
"are unable or refuse to cohabit, and there are no prospects for a reconciliation between the "


parties. It is not necessary to show that either party is at fault in any way. The only question 


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 7 "


to be determined is whether or not there are prospects for reconciliation. 
O.C.G.A. §19-5-3 (13) 
"Harwell v. Harwell, 233 Ga. 89 (1974) "
"McCoy v. McCoy, 281 Ga. 604 (2007) "


The fact that one party has hope for reconciliation is not sufficient evidence to 
sustain a finding that there are genuine prospects for reconciliation. If you find from the 
evidence that there are no genuine prospects for reconciliation and that the marriage is 
"irretrievably broken, then you would be authorized to grant a divorce to the parties. If you "
find that there are prospects for reconciliation and that the marriage is not irretrievably 
"broken, then you would not be authorized to return a verdict granting a divorce. "


"McCoy v. McCoy, 236 Ga. 633 (1976) "


22.090 Divorce; Issues Incidental 

(If you find that the divorce is to be granted) You must decide issues incidental to divorce. I 
will charge you first on equitable division of property/alimony. (The issue of child support 
must be decided in a separate phase of the trial after you have decided [equitable 


"division/alimony], and I will charge you on that issue at that time.) "


22.100 Equitable Division of Property 


22.110 General 

"In this case, the plaintiff/defendant is/are asking for an equitable division of property. The "
purpose behind the doctrine of equitable division of property is to be sure that property 
accumulated during the marriage is fairly distributed between the parties. 


"Payson v. Payson, 274 Ga. 231 (2001) "


22.120 Classification of Property 
"In making an equitable division of property, first classify the property as nonmarital or "


marital. 


"8 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


22.121 Nonmarital Property 
Nonmarital property is property that was acquired before the marriage by any means or 
"property that was acquired during the marriage by gift from a third party (that is, someone "
other than the other spouse) or by inheritance or by bequest in a will. Nonmarital property 
can be converted to marital property by an action of the property owner spouse. Whether 
nonmarital property is converted is a question of fact for you to decide. You should assign to 
each spouse his or her nonmarital property.

"(Note: Give the following only when funds derived from sale, exchange, or use of nonmarital "
property must be traced by the jury.) 

"Property that is acquired during the marriage from funds obtained from the sale, "
"exchange, or use of separate property shall remain the separate property of the person who "
contributed the funds. This separate property remains the separate property of the individual 
"who acquired it, “the property owning spouse.” This separate property may be subject to "
"equitable division only if you find that it has appreciated (that is, increased in value) due to "
marital efforts or has been converted to marital property by an action of the owning spouse. I 
will give you instructions on how to deal with such appreciation later.

22.123 Marital Property 
All other property that was acquired during the marriage and that was not purchased from 
sale or exchange of separate property is marital property that shall be subject to equitable 
division. Marital property is property that is acquired as a direct result of the labor and 
investments of the husband and/or the wife during the course of the marriage or separate 
property that has been converted to marital property by an action of the property owning 
spouse. To determine if property purchased or otherwise acquired during the marriage is 
marital property and therefore subject to being divided between the spouses or if it is the 
"separate property of either the husband or the wife and is not subject to division of property, "
you must determine what was the source of the funds to purchase or acquire the property 
"and/or if the property was separate but due to the action of the property owning spouse, it is "
converted to marital property. The last day on which assets may be acquired so as to be 
considered marital assets is the day of the final decree of divorce.

22.124 Appreciation in Value of Nonmarital Property 
If you find that any nonmarital property has increased in value as a result of the efforts of 
"either or both parties during the marriage, then the increase in value is subject to an equitable "
"division. However, if you find that any nonmarital property has increased in value but the "
"increase in value is not as a result of the efforts of either party or both parties, then this "
increase would not be subject to an equitable division.

"Payson v. Payson, 274 Ga. 231 (2001) "


22.130 Property Title 
The fact that the property is titled in the name of one party or in the name of both parties is 
"not the determining factor. (Furthermore, gifts of property between a husband and a wife "
during the marriage do not vest such title in the other spouse to exclude that property from 
being divided in an equitable division of marital property.) 

"Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765 (1980) "

"While property may be initially obtained as separate property, that property may be "
"converted into a marital asset by the actions of the separate property owner spouse, such as "
"transferring full, partial, or joint ownership in the property to his/her spouse. "

"Lerch v. Lerch, 278 Ga. 885 (2005) "

22.150 Factors in Equitable Division 

"Equitable division of marital property may or may not be an equal division of property, and "
this is a matter for the jury to determine. (After you have determined what property is 
nonmarital property and what property is marital property) In order to make an equitable 
"division of marital property, you should consider the duration of the marriage; any prior "


"marriage of either party; the age, health, occupation, and vocational skills and employability "


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 11 "


of each party; and the contribution or services of each spouse to the family unit. You should 
"also consider the amount and sources of income, the estate, debts, liabilities, and needs of "
"the parties, as well as debts against the property, and the opportunity of each party for future "
"acquisition of assets by employment or otherwise. Furthermore, the conduct of the parties, "
"both during the marriage and with reference to the cause of the divorce, is relevant and may "
be considered in your determination of an equitable division of marital property. 

"Peters v. Peters, 248 Ga. 490 (1981) "

"Bloomfield v. Bloomfield, 282 Ga. 108 (2007) "


22.170 Methods of Equitable Division 
"In making an equitable division of property in this case, you should bear in mind that the law "
permits you to make an equitable division of property in several different ways: 

1) You may make an equitable division of specific personal property or real 

property. 
"That is, you may designate a specific property (such as so many shares of stock "
in a named company or a certain house or tract of land) to be awarded as 
equitable division of property. 

"2) You may make an equitable division of property in cash. That is, you may "
designate a certain sum of money to be awarded as an equitable division of 
"property, even though that sum of money is not presently in the form of cash. "

3) You may make an equitable division of property by awarding specific items of 
property and also awarding an amount in cash. 

4) You may award percentages of property to spouses or require the parties to sell 
property and award the proceeds equitably to the parties. 

"Clements v. Clements, 255 Ga. 714 (1986) "


22.180 Resulting Trust; Equitable Division 

"The plaintiff/defendant is claiming an entitlement to certain property, not as part of an "
"equitable division, but rather because of a resulting trust set up by the parties. The "
defendant/plaintiff is denying that any resulting trust in the property was ever established 


and that the defendant/plaintiff holds title to the property and owns the property by right. 


"12 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


When a party purchases property (in whole or in part) to be placed in a spouse’s 
"name and there is a delivery and acceptance of the title to the property by the other spouse, "
then it is presumed under law that the property is a gift. That presumption may be rebutted if 
it is shown that a resulting trust was established. In order to show that a resulting trust was 
"established, the party claiming that the trust was established must prove, by clear and "
"convincing evidence, that the property was purchased with the party’s own funds and for the "
"party’s own benefit, and that the title to such property (in whole or in part) was placed in the "
other spouse as a matter of convenience or as an agreement for some other purpose and that 
the spouse was holding title to the property merely as trustee for the benefit of the other 
spouse. 

The presumption of a gift may be rebutted by evidence showing that the party who 
made the purchase thereafter exercised ownership over the property in such a manner as was 
"inconsistent with ownership by the other spouse. In determining this issue, you may consider "
evidence of any acts by the spouse holding title whereby that spouse appeared to recognize 
that actual ownership was in the other spouse. 

If you find by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s own 
funds were used to purchase (specify property in dispute) and that the plaintiff/defendant put 
"the title to all or part of it in the name of the other spouse, and if you further find that, at the "
"time the plaintiff/defendant did so, the parties recognized and agreed that the spouse holding "
"the title was doing so as the trustee for the spouse who purchased the property, then you "
should find that a resulting trust was created and you should award the title to the property 
back to_the defendant/plaintiff. If you find that there was no such recognition and agreement 
"between the parties, then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of the "
"other spouse would be considered a gift of (_interest in) the property, and you should not "
find a resulting trust but should leave the title as is. 

"O.C.G.A. §53-12-1 et seq., 53-12-91 "
"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 727 (1978); overruled on other grounds "
"Harrell v. Harrell, 249 Ga. 170 (1982) "


"(See 02.040, Clear and Convincing Evidence. Clarke v. Cotton, 263 Ga. 861 [1994].) "


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 13 "


"(If alimony or child support is also in issue, include the following.) "

After you have decided this issue and which party will have the actual ownership of 
"the property, then the property should be considered by you as being in that party’s "
estate upon your consideration of the issue(s) of alimony and/or child support. You should 
decide the issue of the alleged resulting trust before considering the issue(s) of alimony 
and/or child support. 

"As [have instructed you, the plaintiff/defendant (both parties) is (are) seeking an "
award of alimony from the other party. Alimony may (or may not) be awarded based upon 
"the evidence presented as to entitlement, need, and ability to pay; it may be denied for "
adultery/desertion/misconduct. In determining whether a resulting trust as to certain property 
"was set up by these parties, you are not to concern yourselves with the elements of "
"entitlement to alimony, financial need, or the ability to pay. (Nor should you concern "
yourselves with any evidence as to adultery/desertion/misconduct that may have caused the 


separation of the parties). 


22.182 Inceptive Fraud (Constructive Trust); Equitable Division 
"The plaintiff/defendant is claiming an entitlement to certain property, namely, not as part of "
"an equitable division, but rather because of an alleged inceptive fraud by the other spouse. "
The defendant/plaintiff denies any inceptive fraud. The defendant/plaintiff claims to hold the 
title to the property and to own it legally and by right. This claim presents another issue for 
you to determine. 

"Parks v. Parks, 240 Ga. 1 (1977) "

"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 728 fn. 2 (1978); overruled on other grounds "


If a person purchases property with their own funds but causes the title to (an interest 
in) the property to be placed in their spouse’s name and there is a delivery and acceptance of 
"the (title to the) property, then it is presumed under law to be a gift. However, that "
presumption may be rebutted if it is shown that inceptive fraud occurred. To show inceptive 
"fraud, it must be established that the spouse receiving (title to) the property made a promise "
to the purchasing spouse to induce the purchasing spouse to execute the deed (make the 


"transfer, etc.) and the promise was fraudulently made with no intent to comply. "


"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 728 (1978); overruled on other grounds "


"14 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


If you find that the plaintiff/defendant transferred (executed) the deed to certain 
"property (or an interest in certain property) to his/her spouse, in return for and because of a "
"promise made by that spouse, but that the promise was fraudulently made by the "
"defendant/plaintiff with the intention not to comply, then you may find that the "
defendant/plaintiff committed inceptive fraud in obtaining the title (property) (interest in the 
"property), and the deed (transfer) may be set aside and the property awarded to the spouse "
who originally purchased (owned) it. 

"If you find that there was no inceptive fraud on the part of the defendant/plaintiff, "
then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of his/her spouse would be 
"considered a gift (a interest in the property), and you should not find any "


inceptive fraud but should leave the property as presently titled. 


"(If alimony or child support is also in issue, include the following.) "

After you have decided this issue and determined which person will have actual 
"ownership of the property, then you should consider the property as being in that person’s "
estate upon your consideration of the issue(s) of alimony/child support. You should decide 
the issue of inceptive fraud before considering the issue(s) of alimony/child support. 

"As I have instructed you, the plaintiff/defendant (both parties) is (are) seeking an "
award of alimony from the other party. (Alimony may or may not be awarded based upon 
"the evidence presented as to entitlement, need, and ability to pay, and may be denied for "
adultery/desertion/misconduct.) In determining whether or not the plaintiff/defendant 
"committed inceptive fraud, you are not to concern yourselves with the question of "


"entitlement to alimony, financial need, or the ability to pay. "


22.184 Partitioning; Equitable Division 
The plaintiff/defendant/both parties is/are claiming that certain property should be divided or 
partitioned between them. Any property owned either in whole or in part by the other spouse 
may be divided between them on an equitable basis. This is not an award of alimony but an 
equitable division of property. 

"Stokes v. Stokes, 246 Ga. 765, 771 (1980) "

"Daniel v. Daniel, 277 Ga. 871 (2004) "


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 15 "


22.190 Coordination of Equitable Division with Nonmarital/Separate Property 
Nonmarital property that belongs to one of the parties may be taken into account in deciding 
"the equities of the division of marital property between the parties. However, nonmarital "
property may not be awarded to the other party as an equitable division of property. 
Nonmarital property must be awarded to the party who you find owns it according to the 


instructions I have given you. 


22.200 Introduction to Alimony 
(Give the following portion of the charge only if alimony is requested.) 

"I have just given you instructions about equitable division of property. Next, I am "
going to instruct you about alimony. 


(name the party) is asking for an award of alimony. 





You can only make an equitable division of property from marital property (as I 
"have just instructed you), but you can make an alimony award from anything that a person "
owns or is awarded to them as their equitable division of property or from future earnings. 

The order of these instructions does not mean that you have to make a decision 
about equitable division of property before deciding alimony. You may decide equitable 
"division before deciding alimony, or you may decide alimony before deciding equitable "
"division of property. You may grant alimony and no equitable division of property, or you "
"may grant equitable division of property and no alimony, or you may grant both, or you may "


grant neither. 


22.210 Alimony 
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, alimony is defined as an award from one party for the "
support of the other when the parties are living separate and apart. 
O.C.G.A. §19-6-1(a) 
"You are authorized, but not required, to award alimony to the party claiming a right "
to alimony in accordance with that party’s needs and the other party’s ability to pay. 


O.C.G.A. §19-6-1(c) 


"16 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


(The following should be used if the charge on equitable division of property has 
been given.) 

"If you decide to make an award of alimony in this case, then you should take into "
consideration whether such award is in place of or in addition to an award of equitable 
"division of property. Additionally, you should bear in mind that assets assigned as "
nonmarital property that were not subject to an equitable division may be awarded as 
alimony. 

"Before considering the amount of alimony to be awarded, you must first decide "
whether the party (parties) requesting alimony should receive alimony at all. 

A spouse is not entitled to alimony as a matter of right solely because the parties 
"have been married. In determining whether or not to grant alimony, you should consider "
"evidence, if any, of the factual cause of the separation between parties. You may also "
"consider evidence, if any, of each party’s conduct toward the other. "

0.C.G.A. §19-6-1 

"Odom v. Odom, 239 Ga. 830 (1977) "
"Duncan v. Duncan, 262 Ga. 872 (1993) "
"Weir v. Weir, 287 Ga. 443 (2010) "


22.220 Adultery 

You shall not award alimony to a party claiming alimony if the preponderance of the 
evidence shows that the party claiming alimony committed adultery and this adultery caused 
the parties to separate. A married person commits adultery when he or she voluntarily has 
sexual intercourse with someone other than his or her spouse. 


O.C.G.A. 19-6-1 (b) 


22.230 Desertion 
You shall not award alimony to a party claiming alimony if the preponderance of the 
evidence shows that the party claiming alimony deserted his/her spouse and that desertion 


"caused the parties to separate. To find desertion, you must find that the spouse left "


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 17 "


"1) intentionally and willfully, without just cause; "


2) without the consent of the other spouse; and 


3) with an intention never to return to the marriage relationship. 


"Rogers v. Rogers, 202 Ga. 329 (1947) "


"However, it is not desertion if you find that the party claiming alimony was driven "


off by the other spouse. 


22.24


Amount of Alimony 


"If, based on all the evidence, you determine that the party claiming alimony is entitled to "


"alimony, then you must decide the amount, type, or kind of alimony to be awarded. "
"Walton v. Walton, 219 Ga. 729 (1964) "
"McNally v. McNally, 223 Ga. 246 (1967) "
"Farrish v. Farrish, 279 Ga. 551 (2005) "
"Rieffel v. Rieffel, 281 Ga. 891 (2007) "


"In determining the amount of alimony, if any, to be awarded, you should consider the "


following: 
1) the standard of living established during the marriage; 
2) the duration of the marriage; 
3) the age and the physical and emotional condition of each party; 
4) the financial resources of each party; 
"5) if applicable, the time necessary for either party to acquire sufficient education or "
training to enable him/her to find appropriate employment; 
"6) the contribution of each party to the marriage, including, but not limited to, "


18


"services rendered in homemaking, child care, education, and career building of "


the other party; 


"Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


"7) the condition of each party, including their separate estate, earning capacity, and "
fixed liabilities; and 
8) such other relevant factors as you deem equitable and proper. 


O.C.G.A. § 19-6-5 (a)(1-8) 


22.250 Types of Alimony Awards; Method of Payment 
"If you decide to make an award of alimony, you should bear in mind that the law permits "
alimony to be awarded in several ways: 

a) Lump sum alimony. You may make a lump sum cash award to be paid out of the 
"estate or assets of the other spouse, and you may require that such a lump sum be "
paid in one payment or in installments for a specific period of time. If you find 
"that the evidence warrants the payment of a lump sum of alimony in installments, "
you should bear in mind that this award is considered a property award and will 
not terminate upon the death of either party and that such payments will be 
payable to or by the estate of a deceased party. 

"b) Alimony in kind. You may make an award of alimony in kind, which means an "
"award of designated property, including personal property and real estate, or an "
award of a designated interest in real or personal property. Property as used here 
"includes not only personal property (such as automobiles, household furnishings, "
insurance policies) but also real property (such as ownership of an interest in 
land). The property may be sold and may be divided in whatever manner you 
decide as justified by the evidence. You should bear in mind that this award is 
considered a property award and will not terminate upon the death of either party 
and that such payments will be payable to or by the estate of a deceased party. 

c) Periodic alimony. You may make an award of periodic alimony payments to be 
"paid in the future; for instance weekly, monthly, or quarterly payments. This "
award of periodic alimony payments will terminate upon the death of either party 


and is not chargeable to the estate of a deceased party. 


Awards of lump sum alimony or a property award payable in installments will not 


"end upon the spouse’s remarriage or death. However, all obligations for periodic alimony, "


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 19 "


"however created, where the time for performance has not arrived, end upon the remarriage "
of the party to whom the obligations are owed unless otherwise specified. 


O.C.G.A. §19-6-5(b) 


You may make an award of alimony by using any one of these three methods or by 
"combining any two of these three methods or by using all three of these methods, if you find "


the evidence justifies you in doing so. 


(The following should be used if the charge on equitable division of property has 
been given.) 
Any award you make for alimony should take into consideration whether such award 


is in place of or in addition to an award of equitable division of property. 


22.260 Resulting Trust; Alimony 

"The plaintiff/defendant is claiming an entitlement to certain property, not as an award of "
"alimony, but rather because of resulting trust set up by the parties. The defendant/plaintiff is "
denying that any resulting trust in the property was ever established and that the 
defendant/plaintiff holds title to the property and owns the property by right. 

When a party purchases property (in whole or in part) to be placed in a spouse’s 
"name, and there is a delivery and acceptance of the title to the property by the other spouse, "
then it is presumed under law that the property is a gift. That presumption may be rebutted if 
it is shown that a resulting trust was established. In order to show that a resulting trust was 
"established, the party claiming that the trust was established must prove, by clear and "
"convincing evidence, that the property was purchased with the party’s own funds and for the "
"party’s own benefit, and that the title to such property (in whole or in part) was placed in the "
other spouse as a matter of convenience or as an agreement for some other purpose and that 
the spouse was holding title to the property merely as trustee for the benefit of the other 
spouse. 

The presumption of a gift may be rebutted by evidence showing that the party who 
made the purchase thereafter exercised ownership over the property in such a manner as was 


"inconsistent with ownership by the other spouse. In determining this issue, you may consider "


"20 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


evidence of any acts by the spouse holding title whereby that spouse appeared to recognize 
that actual ownership was in the other spouse. 

If you find by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s own 
funds were used to purchase (specify property in dispute) and that the plaintiff/defendant put 
"the title to all or part of it in the name of the other spouse, and if you further find that, at the "
"time the plaintiff/defendant did so, the parties recognized and agreed that the spouse holding "
"the title was doing so as the trustee for the spouse who purchased the property, then you "
should find that a resulting trust was created and you should award the title to the property 
back to the defendant/plaintiff. If you find that there was no such recognition and agreement 
"between the parties, then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of the "
"other spouse would be considered a gift of (_interest in) the property, and you should not "
find a resulting trust but should leave the title as is. 

"O.C.G.A. §53-12-1 et seq., 53-12-91 "
"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 727 (1978); overruled on other grounds "
"Harrell v. Harrell, 249 Ga. 170 (1982) "


"(See 02.040, Clear and Convincing Evidence. Clarke v. Cotton, 263 Ga. 861 [1994].) "


"(If alimony or child support is also in issue, include the following.) "

After you have decided this issue and which party will have the actual ownership of 
"the property, then the property should be considered by you as being in that party’s "
estate upon your consideration of the issue(s) of alimony and/or child support. You should 
decide the issue of the alleged resulting trust before considering the issue(s) of alimony 
and/or child support. 

"As [have instructed you, the plaintiff/defendant (both parties) is (are) seeking an "
award of alimony from the other party. Alimony may (or may not) be awarded based upon 
"the evidence presented as to entitlement, need, and ability to pay; it may be denied for "
adultery/desertion/misconduct. In determining whether a resulting trust as to certain property 
"was set up by these parties, you are not to concern yourselves with the elements of "
"entitlement to alimony, financial need, or the ability to pay. (Nor should you concern "


yourselves with any evidence as to adultery/desertion/misconduct that may have caused the 


"Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated January 2019 21 "


separation of the parties). 


22.270 Inceptive Fraud (Constructive Trust); Alimony 
"The plaintiff/defendant is claiming an entitlement to certain property, namely : "
"not as an award of alimony, but rather because of an alleged inceptive fraud by the other "
spouse. The defendant/plaintiff denies any inceptive fraud. The defendant/plaintiff claims to 
hold the title to the property and to own it legally and by right. This claim presents another 
issue for you to determine. 

"Parks v. Parks, 240 Ga. 1 (1977) "

"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 728 fn. 2 (1978); overruled on other grounds "


If a person purchases property with their own funds but causes the title to (an interest 
in) the property to be placed in their spouse’s name and there is a delivery and acceptance of 
"the (title to the) property, then it is presumed under law to be a gift. However, that "
presumption may be rebutted if it is shown that inceptive fraud occurred. To show inceptive 
"fraud, it must be established that the spouse receiving (title to) the property made a promise "
to the purchasing spouse to induce the purchasing spouse to execute the deed (make the 


"transfer, etc.) and the promise was fraudulently made with no intent to comply. "


"Hargrett v. Hargrett, 242 Ga. 725, 728 (1978); overruled on other grounds "

If you find that the plaintiff/defendant transferred (executed) the deed to certain 
property (or an interest in certain property) to his/her spouse in return for and because of a 
promise made by that spouse but that the promise was fraudulently made by the 
"defendant/plaintiff with the intention not to comply, then you may find that the "
defendant/plaintiff committed inceptive fraud in obtaining the title (property) (interest in the 
"property), and the deed (transfer) may be set aside and the property awarded to the spouse "
who originally purchased (owned) it. 

"If you find that there was no inceptive fraud on the part of the defendant/plaintiff, "
then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of his/her spouse would be 
"considered a gift (a interest in the property), and you should not find any "


inceptive fraud but should leave the property as presently titled. 


"(If alimony or child support is also in issue, include the following.) "


"22 Updated January 2019 Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony "


After you have decided this issue and determined which person will have actual 
"ownership of the property, then you should consider the property as being in that person’s "
estate upon your consideration of the issue(s) of alimony/ child support. You should decide 
the issue of inceptive fraud before considering the issue(s) of alimony/child support. 

"As I have instructed you, the plaintiff/defendant (both parties) is (are) seeking an "
award for alimony from the other party. (Alimony may or may not be awarded based upon 
"the evidence presented as to entitlement, need, and ability to pay, and may be denied for "
adultery/desertion/misconduct.) In determining whether or not the plaintiff/defendant 
"committed inceptive fraud, you are not to concern yourselves with the question of "


"entitlement to alimony, financial need, or the ability to pay. "


22.280 Partitioning; Alimony 
The plaintiff/defendant/both parties is/are claiming that certain property should be divided or 
partitioned between them. Any property owned either in whole or in part by the other spouse 
may be divided between them on an equitable basis. This is not an award of alimony but an 
equitable division of property.

22.290 Coordination of Alimony and Nonmarital/Separate Property 
Nonmarital property that belongs to one of the parties may be taken into account in deciding 


questions of alimony. 


22.300 Child Support; Determined Later 
(Charge only if child support is at issue). 

After you make your determinations about (divorce/equitable division of 
"property/alimony) and have returned your verdict, you will be called upon to decide issues "
"of child support. While you have heard the evidence relevant to child support, you have not "

issues in arriving at your verdict on the issues of (divorce/equitable division/alimony).

10 Updated August 2020 Child Support 


If you determine that a deviation from the presumptive amount of child support is 
"appropriate, you shall consider all available income of the parents. "

There are several categories that qualify as specific deviations from the presumptive 
"amount of child support which you may consider. Depending on the evidence presented, you "
"may find that more than one specific deviation applies, or you may find that no deviations "
apply. You may apply specific deviations from the presumptive amount if you find it to be 


in the best interest of the child. 
O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15(4)(2) 


(You may find that a deviation from the presumptive amount of child support is 
appropriate for reasons in addition to the specific deviations; this is a nonspecific deviation. 
You may apply nonspecific deviations from the presumptive amount if you find it to be in 


the best interest of the child).

"the highest amount allowed by the child support guidelines, which is , but you may "

23.535 Low Income 

"If the noncustodial parent requests a low-income deviation, and such parent presents "
evidence sufficient to demonstrate no earning capacity or that his/her pro rata share of the 
presumptive amount of child support would create an extreme economic hardship for such 
"parent, you may consider a low income deviation. (A noncustodial parent whose sole source "
of income is supplemental security income received under Title XVI of the federal Social 
Security Act shall be considered to have no earning capacity.) 

In considering the noncustodial parent’s request for a low-income deviation you shall 
"then examine all attributable and excluded sources of income, assets, and benefits and all "
reasonable expenses of the noncustodial parent. You shall ensure that such expenses are 
actually paid by the noncustodial parent and are clearly justified expenses. Then you shall 
weigh the relative hardship that a reduction in the amount of child support paid to the 
"custodial parent would have on the custodial parent’s household, the needs of each parent, "
"the needs of the child(ren) for whom child support is being determined, and the ability of the "
noncustodial parent to pay child support. 

"Upon review of the noncustodial parent’s gross income and expenses, and taking into "
account each parent’s adjusted child support obligation and the relative hardships on the 
"parents and the child(ren), you may consider a downward deviation to attain an appropriate "
award of child support which is consistent with the best interest of the child(ren). 

"For the purpose of calculating a low-income deviation, the noncustodial parent’s "
"minimum child support for one child shall be no less than $100.00 per month, (and such "
amount shall be increased by at least $50.00 for each additional child for whom child 
support is being determined). 

"(If a low-income deviations is granted by you, such deviation shall not prohibit you "
from granting an increase or decrease to the presumptive amount of child support by the use 


of any other specific or nonspecific deviation).

"Under Georgia law, in cases in which the child is in the legal custody of the Department of "
"Human Services, the child protection or foster-care agency of another state or territory, or "
"any other child-caring entity, public or private, you may consider a deviation from the "
presumptive amount of child support if the deviation will assist in accomplishing a 
permanency plan or foster-care plan for the child that has a goal of returning the child to the 
parent or parents and the parent’s need to establish an adequate household or to otherwise 
adequately prepare himself/herself for the return of the child clearly justifies a deviation for 


this purpose.

23.575 Extraordinary Expense; Generally 

The presumptive amount of child support that I have provided to you is based upon average 
child-rearing expenditures for families given the parents’ combined adjusted income and the 
number of children. Georgia law allows you to deviate from this amount in recognition of 
extraordinary expenses. Extraordinary expenses are expenses in excess of average amounts 
used to arrive at the presumptive child support amount and are highly variable among 


families. Extraordinary expenses shall be considered on a case-by-case basis in the 


14 Updated August 2020 Child Support 


calculation of support and may form the basis for deviation from the presumptive amount of 
child support so that the actual amount of the expense is considered in the calculation of the 
final child support order for those families actually incurring the expense. Extraordinary 
expenses shall be prorated between the parents by assigning or deducting credit for actual 


payment for extraordinary expenses. 


23.577 Extraordinary Expense; Education 

You may consider extraordinary educational expenses as a basis for deviation from the 
"presumptive amount of child support. Extraordinary educational expenses include, but are "
"not limited to, tuition, room and board, lab fees, books, fees, and other reasonable and "
necessary expenses associated with special-needs education or private elementary and 
secondary schooling that are appropriate to the parent’s financial abilities and to the lifestyle 
of the child(ren) if the parents and the child(ren)were living together. In determining the 
"amount of deviation for extraordinary educational expenses, scholarships, grants, stipends, "
and other cost-reducing programs received by or on behalf of the child(ren) shall be 
"considered. If a deviation is allowed for extraordinary educational expenses, a monthly "


average of the expenses shall be based on the evidence of prior or anticipated expenses. 


O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15(1)(2)(J)@) 


23.578 Special Expense Incurred for Child Rearing 

You may find special expenses incurred for child rearing to be the basis for deviation from 
"the presumptive child support amount. Special expenses incurred for child rearing include, "
"but are not limited to, quantifiable expense variations related to the food, clothing, and "
"hygiene costs of children at different age levels. Such expenses may include, but are not "
"limited to, summer camp; music or art lessons; travel; school-sponsored extracurricular "
"activities, such as band, clubs, and athletics; and other activities intended to enhance the "
"athletic, social, or cultural development of a child but not otherwise required to be used in "
calculating the presumptive amount of child support. A portion of the basic child support 
obligation is intended to cover average amounts of special expenses incurred in the rearing 
"of a child. In order to determine if a deviation for special expenses is warranted, you shall "


consider the full amount of the special expenses and when these special expenses exceed 7 


Child Support Updated August 2020 15 


"percent of the basic child support obligation, then the additional amount of special expenses "


shall be considered a deviation to cover the full amount of the special expenses.

23.579 Extraordinary Expense; Medical 
In instances of extreme economic hardship involving extraordinary medical expenses not 
"covered by insurance, you may consider a deviation from the presumptive amount of child "
"support for extraordinary medical expenses. Such expenses may include, but are not limited "
"to, extraordinary medical expenses of (the child) (a parent), provided, however, that any "
such deviation shall not leave a child unsupported. This deviation may be ordered for a 
specific period of time measured in months. 

"When extraordinary medical expenses are claimed, you shall consider the resources "
"available for meeting such needs, including sources available from agencies and other "


adults. 


O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15(1)(2)(J) (ii) 


23.580 Extended Parenting Time 

The presumptive child support is based upon Georgia law and is based upon expenditures 
for a child in intact households. You may find a deviation from the presumptive amount of 
child support when special circumstances make the presumptive amount of child support 
excessive or inadequate due to extended parenting time or when the child resides with both 


parents equally or when visitation rights are not being utilized. 


O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15(1)(2)(K) 


23.585 Nonspecific Deviations 

Deviations from the presumptive amount of child support may be appropriate for reasons 
other than those previously charged and if you find that such deviation is in the best interest 
"of the child(ren), you may grant such deviation. You must state the reason for any such "


deviation and the amount thereof in the appropriate place on the verdict form.

(Note: O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15[k][1] provides that a parent may not “ . . . petition for

parent’s income and financial status or the needs of the child” [emphasis added]. There are 
other time-period provisions. O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15[k][4] provides that when a petition for 
"modification comes before a jury, the members “... shall only be responsible for "
"determining a parent’s gross income and any deviations. . . .” [emphasis added]. Thus, it "
appears that the issue of comparison to prior awards and determining the issue of 
“substantial change” and the issues from O.C.G.A. § 19-6-15[k][2] are left as court 
decisions after the jury has determined new income and deviations.

The facts are determined by you from the evidence. The evidence consists of two

"24.010 Employer, Duties of; Generally "
(Charge only such parts of this section as apply to the facts before the court.) 

The employer is bound to exercise ordinary care in the selection of employees and 
not to retain them after knowledge of incompetency. The employer shall use like care in 
furnishing machinery equal to that in general use and reasonably safe for all persons who 
operate it with ordinary care. If there are hidden defects in machinery or dangers involved 
with an employment unknown to the employee of which the employer knows or ought to 


"know, the employer shall give the employee warning. "

"Central of Georgia Railway Co. v. Ray, 129 Ga. 349 (1907) "


"24.020 Employer, Selection and Retention of Employees "

To entitle the employee to recover on the ground that the employer negligently employed an 
"incompetent fellow employee, it must be shown not only that the fellow employee was in "
"fact incompetent but that the employer knew or, in the exercise of due care, should have "
"known this at the time of the employment, or else that the employer negligently retained the "
fellow employee under circumstances that would warrant a finding that the employer knew 
or should have known of such incompetency. The degree of care required of the employer in 


these respects is ordinary care. 


"Gunn v. Willingham, 111 Ga. 427 (1900); distinguished at 124 Ga. 576 (1906) "
"Strickland v. Foughner, 63 Ga. App. 805, 808 (1940) "


"24.030 Employer, Place to Work; Generally "

An employer is bound to exercise ordinary care in furnishing a reasonably safe place for 
employees to work. If there are hidden dangers involved with an employment unknown to 
"the employee or that the employer knows or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should know, "
the employee must be warned about them. But if there are hidden defects involved with the 


employment of which the employer does not know and could not know by the exercise of 


"ordinary care, the employer will be excused for a failure to discover them and will not be "


liable because of them. 


"Holland v. McRae Oil and Fertilizer Co., 134 Ga. 678(8) (1910) "


"24.040 Employer, Place to Work; Changing Conditions "

The general rule of law declaring the duty of an employer in regard to furnishing an 
employee a safe place to work is usually applied to a permanent place. It does not apply to 
places that are constantly shifting and being transformed as a direct result of the employee’s 
labor and where the work’s progress necessarily changes the character of safety of the place 


in which it is performed. 


"Holland v. Durham Coal &amp; Coke Co., 131 Ga. 715(1) (1908) "
"Norris v. American Railway Express Co., 156 Ga. 150, 154 (1923) "


"24.050 Employer, Presumption of Ordinary Care "

The presumption exists that the employer exercised ordinary care in the selection of 
employees. One who complains of injuries that one alleges resulted from the incompetency 
of a fellow employee must overcome this presumption by direct proof and cannot 
successfully rebut the presumption by inferences drawn from facts that fail to disclose that 


"the employer knew, or should have known, of the incompetency of the fellow employee. "

"24.060 Employer, Duty to Warn Employee "
If there are dangers involved in an employment unknown to the employee of which the 
"employer knows or, in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, the employer must "

If an employee should have equal opportunity of discovering incompetency on the part of a 
"fellow employee or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known it, the employee "


cannot recover for injuries resulting from such incompetency. 


O.C.G.A. §34-7-23 


"24.080 Employee, Machinery "

In order for an employee to recover damages from an employer for injuries received from 
"the employer’s machinery, it must be shown by the evidence that the employer knew of the "
defect or danger in the machinery or could have discovered it by the exercise of ordinary 
care and that the employee did not know of the defect or danger and did not have equal 


means with the employer of discovering the danger.

If there are hidden defects at the place of employment of which the employer does not know 
and the employee has equal means with the employer of knowing the condition and 
"circumstances of the place of employment, the employee cannot recover for injuries suffered "

Due care by a child of tender years is such as the child’s mental and physical capacities 
enable him/her to exercise in the actual circumstances of the occasion and situation under

to exercise due care according to the child’s age and actual capacity.

The employee assumes such risks as are normally and reasonably involved in the occupation 
and is not held to have assumed such risks as are unusual and not necessarily involved in the 
employment of which the employee did not know and by the exercise of ordinary care for 
his/her own safety could not have known and concerning which the employee did not have 


equal means with the employer of knowing.

"If a suit should be brought under the Federal Employer’s Liability Act, and it should not be "
shown that injury or death resulted from a violation of a federal statute for the protection of 
"the employees, the doctrine of assumed risk would apply. No presumption of negligence "
"against the employer would exist, since under those circumstances the employee would be "


held to have assumed the usual and ordinary risks incident to employment.

"24.220 Employee, Railroad Employees; Statutory Violations by Railroad "

If an action should be brought against a common carrier railroad that is to recover damages 
"for injuries to or the death of an employee, such employee shall not be held to have assumed "
risks of employment in any case in which the violation by the common carrier of any statute 


enacted for the safety of the employees contributed to the injury or death of the employee.

"Southern Railway Co. v. Perkins, 33 Ga. App. 504(2) (1925) "


"24.230 Employee, Railroad Employees; Comparative Negligence Rule Applies "
"In an action brought against a common carrier, which is a railroad, to recover damages for "
"personal injuries to, or the death of, an employee, the fact that the employee may have been "
"guilty of contributory negligence will not bar a recovery, unless the contributory negligence "
of the employee amounted to a failure to exercise ordinary care for his/her own safety. If it 
"amounted to such failure or was equal to or greater than the negligence of the employer, no "
recovery can be had. If it did not amount to such failure and was less than the negligence of 
"the employer, a recovery may be had, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in "
"proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee, provided no such "
injured employee shall be held contributorily negligent in any case in which a violation by 
the common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the 


death or injury of such employee. 


O.C.G.A. §34-7-42 


"24.240 Employee, Railroad Employees; Care for Own Safety "

The rule of law that an employee assumes the ordinary risks of employment makes it the 
employee’s duty to exercise the skill and care to protect against such risks. This rule applies 
"to a common carrier, which is a railroad, as well as to other employers. To recover because "


of alleged act of negligence on the part of the employer it must appear that 


"1) the employer was negligent, "


"2) the employee did not know of the negligence, "

3) the employee did not have equal means with the employer of knowing of the

26.000 FRAUD AND DECEIT 


26.010 Fraud and Deceit; Definitions; Presumption and Proof 
(Note: Constructive fraud is an equitable doctrine only and will not support an action for 
"money damages. In order to support an action for damages, a misrepresentation must be "
made either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the consequences. See Nalley 
"Northside Chevrolet v. Herring, 215 Ga. App. 185 (1994). See Consolidated American "
"Insurance Company v. Spears, 218 Ga. App. 478 (1995).) "

A person commits fraud when that person makes a misrepresentation that is 


intended to deceive and that does deceive. 
"Thompson v. Wilkins, 143 Ga. App. 739 (1977) "


[Fraud may be actual or constructive. Actual fraud consists of any method by which 
another is deceived. Constructive fraud consists of any act done (or not done that should 
"have been done) contrary to legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence upon which another "
"person relies to the injury of that person. Actual fraud implies moral guilt, while "
constructive fraud may be consistent with innocence.] (Give bracketed paragraph only when 
constructive fraud is alleged.) 

"Fraud may not be presumed, but slight circumstances may be enough to prove its "


"existence. To prove fraud, the following elements are required: "


"1) a false representation, "

"2) intent to deceive, "

3) an intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting in reliance on the 
"false representation, "

"4) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff on the false representation, and "

(depending on the relief sought by plaintiff) either a rescission of the sale or an 
apportionment of the price according to relative value. 

Fraud that avoids a sale of lands may be legal as well as moral. Misrepresentations 
made by one party with the intent to deceive the other or that actually deceive the other

Incidental damages resulting from the seller’s breach include expenses reasonably incurred 
"in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected and "
"commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions in connection with effecting "


cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach. 


26.512 Fraud and Deceit; Buyer’s Consequential Damages 


Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s breach include 


1) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the 
seller at the time of the contracting had reason to know and which could not 
"reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise, and "


2) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty. 


"“Cover,” for the purpose of this lawsuit, means the right of the buyer, in good faith "
"and without unreasonable delay, to buy or contract to buy goods that are a reasonable "
substitute for those claimed to be due from the seller. The measure of damages is the 
"difference between the cost of the substitution purchase and the contract price, together with "

28.010 Gifts; Essentials; Acceptance 

"To constitute a valid gift, there shall be the intention to give by the donor, acceptance by "

"the donee, and delivery of the article or some act accepted by the law in place of delivery. "
"If the gift is of substantial benefit, the law will presume the acceptance, unless the "

"contrary is shown. A parent, guardian, or friend may accept for an infant. The officers of "

"O.C.G.A. §§44-5-80, 44-5-81 "


28.020 Gifts; Personal Property; Delivery; Generally 
Actual manual delivery of personal property is not essential to the validity of a gift. Any 
"act that indicates a renunciation of possession by the donor, and the transfer of control to "
"the donee, shall be a constructive delivery. "

All kinds of personal property that are capable of manual delivery and of which 
"the title, either legal or equitable, can be transferred by delivery may be the subject matter "


"of a valid gift, whether delivery be actual or constructive. "

The exclusive possession by a child of lands which originally belonged to the parent or 
"parents, without payment of rent, for the space of seven years, creates a rebuttable "
presumption of a gift and conveys title to the child. The presumption may be rebutted by 
"evidence of a loan, of a claim of dominion by the parent or parents acknowledged by the "


"child, of a disclaimer of title by the child, or similar evidence. "

performance of the agreement.

30.200 Implied Obligations; Family Transactions; Generally 

The particular facts of each case will determine whether the usual implication of a promise 
to pay for services accepted is rebutted by the fact of close relationship between the parties. 
In determining what circumstances are sufficient to imply a promise to pay for services 
"rendered in cases of close relationship, the nature and value of the services rendered and the "


physical and financial conditions of the parties should be taken into account.

30.210 Implied Obligations; Parent and Child 
In order to entitle a child to recover against a parent for services rendered in the nature of 


care and attention such as are usually bestowed because of a natural sense of duty and 


"affection arising out of the relationship, it must affirmatively appear that the services "
"rendered were performed under an express contract that the party would pay for the same, or "
the surrounding circumstances must clearly indicate that it was the intention of both parties 
that compensation should be made. What circumstances would be sufficient to support an 


implication of a promise to pay for such services is a question for the jury to determine.

"property, the law would imply a promise on the part of the other person to pay the "


reasonable value of the property.

32.010 Insurance; Misrepresentation; Generally 

All statements and descriptions in any application for an insurance policy or annuity contract 
or in negotiations for them by or in behalf of the insured or annuitant shall be deemed to be 
"representations and not warranties. Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts, and "


incorrect statements shall not prevent a recovery under the policy of contract unless 


"1) itis fraudulent, "

2) itis material either to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the 
"insurer, "

3) the insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract or would 
not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount or at the premium rate as 
applied for or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting 
"in the loss, if the true facts had been known to the insurer as required either by the "


application for the policy or contract or otherwise. 


O.C.G.A. §33-24-7 


"32.020 Insurance; Misrepresentations, Innocent "
When there is not clear and unequivocal limitation on the authority of the agent of the 
"insurance company and no fraud or collusion between the agent and the prospective insured, "
the company is presumed to know any facts that the agent knows amounting to innocent 
misrepresentations and cannot claim lack of knowledge as a defense. 

If there was a misrepresentation in the application for insurance and it was attached 
"to the policy and made a part of it and it was material in that it changed the nature, extent, "
"and character of the risk, it would void the policy even though it was made innocently and in "


good faith.

32.100 Insurance; Failure to Pay Claim; Bad Faith 

If you find that the insurer has exercised bad faith in refusing to pay a claim within sixty 
"days after demand, the insurer shall be liable, in addition to the loss, for a penalty up to 50 "
"percent of the amount of the loss or $5,000, whichever is greater, and all reasonable "
"attorney’s fees. You must determine, first, how much the loss was and, second, how much "
penalty the plaintiff is entitled to receive. The penalty may be any amount as determined by 
"the jury up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the loss or $5,000, whichever is greater. You "
must then determine how much the attorney’s fees shall be on the basis of evidence brought 
"before you as to the reasonable value of the services, based on time spent and legal and "
factual issues involved in accordance with prevailing fees. Your verdict should fix the 
"amount of the loss first and then, if you find that bad faith existed, make separate findings as "
"to penalty (not over 50 percent of the loss or $5,000, whichever is greater) and "

attorney’s fees.

2 Insurance 


32.300 Insurable Interest; Life 

“Insurable interest” with reference to personal insurance is an interest based upon a 
"reasonable expectation of monetary advantage through the continued life, health, or bodily "
safety of a person and consequent loss by reason of that person’s death or disability or a 
substantial interest produced by love and affection in the case of individuals closely related 
by blood or by law. 

"Individuals have an unlimited insurable interest in their own life, health, and bodily "
"safety and may lawfully take out a policy of insurance on their own life, health, or bodily "
"safety and have the policy made payable to whomever they please, regardless of whether the "
designated beneficiary has an insurable interest. 

(Use if applicable.) 


A corporation has an insurable interest in 


a) the life or physical or mental ability of 
"1) its directors, officers, or employees, or those of its subsidiaries, or any "
other person whose death or disability might cause it financial loss; or 
"2) ashareholder, pursuant to a contractual arrangement concerning the "
reacquisition of shares owned by the shareholder at the time of death or 
disability or 
b) the life of the principal obligor pursuant to 
1) acontract obligating the corporation as part of compensation arrangements or 


2) acontract obligating the corporation as guarantor or surety. 


(Use if applicable.) 

"The trustee of a trust established by a corporation providing life, health, disability, "
"retirement, or similar benefits to employees of the corporation or its affiliates and acting in a "
"fiduciary capacity with respect to such employees, retired employees, or their dependants or "
beneficiaries has an insurable interest in the lives of employees for whom such benefits are 
to be provided. 

(Use if applicable.) 

The insurable interest of a corporation or trustee shall be conveyed automatically to 


another corporation or to the trustee of a trust established by such other corporation for its 


Insurance 3 


"sole benefit that has acquired by purchase, merger, or otherwise all or part of the first "
corporation’s business. 

A corporation or the trustee of a trust may exchange any policy of insurance issued 
to itself or to another corporation or the trustee of a trust established by such other 
corporation for its sole benefit from which the exchanging corporation has acquired by 
"purchase, merger, or otherwise all or part of such other corporation’s business for a new "
policy of insurance issued to itself without establishing a new insurable interest at the time 


of such exchange. 
"O.C.G.A. §33-24-3(c), (c.1) "


(Give in all cases.) 

An insurable interest must exist at the time the contract of personal insurance 
"becomes effective, but this requirement need not exist at the time the loss occurs. "

Any personal insurance contract procured (caused to be procured) upon another is 
void unless the benefits are payable to the individual insured or that person’s representative 
"or to a person having, at the time the contract was made, an insurable interest in the "
"individual insured. When a contract is void, the insurer shall not be liable on the contract but "


"shall be liable to repay to the person(s) who have paid the premiums, without interest. "


O.C.G.A. §33-24-3 


32.400 Insurable Interest; Property 

No insurance contract on property or of any interest in it or arising from it shall be 
"enforceable except for the benefit of persons having, at the time of the loss, an insurable "
interest in the things insured. 

"“Insurable interest” as used in this section means any actual, lawful, and substantial "
"economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, "
"destruction, or monetary damage or impairment. "

The measure of an insurable interest in property is the extent to which the insured 


"might be damaged by loss, injury, or impairment of it. "

34.020 Usury; Intention; Indirect Means

that allowed by law. 

"If such intent existed at the time the contract was executed, the fact that it was "
"accomplished indirectly, as by way of commission for advances, discount, exchange, or by "
"any contract or scheme or contrivance or device whatever, would not excuse it. "

36.020 Landlord and Tenant; Duty of Landlord at Time of Rental 

It is ordinarily the duty of a landlord to turn over rented property to the tenant in a condition 
"reasonably safe and suited for the tenant’s intended use and free of hidden defects, as the "
exercise of ordinary care on the part of the landlord might have disclosed. A landlord is

particular facts of each case.) 


44.010 Negotiable Instruments; Delivery; Negotiations; Indorsement 
"“Negotiation” means a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or involuntary, of an "


instrument by a person other than the issuer to a person who thereby becomes its holder. 
0.C.G.A. §11-3-201(a) 


(Choose whether “payable to order” or “payable to bearer.” ) 


44.011 Negotiation; Payable to Order 
"If it is payable to order, it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement. An "
"indorsement must be written by or on behalf of the holder, and on the instrument or on a "


paper so firmly affixed as to become a part of it. 
O.C.G.A. §11-3-202 


"Except for negotiations by remitter, if an instrument is payable to an identified "
"person, negotiation requires transfer of possession of the instrument and its indorsement by "


the holder. 


O.C.G.A. §11-3-201(b) 


44.012 Negotiation; Payable to Bearer 
"If it is payable to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery only. An instrument payable to order "
and indorsed in blank becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by delivery alone 
until it is specially indorsed. An indorsement in blank specifies no particular endorsee and 
consists of a mere signature. A special indorsement specifies the person to whom it is 
made payable. 

"O.C.G.A. §§11-3-202, 11-3-204 "

O.C.G.A. §11-3-205(a) 


44.014 Negotiation; Blank Indorsement 
"If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, "
"it is a “blank indorsement.” When endorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to "


bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially endorsed.

"Unless otherwise agreed, any transfer for value of an instrument not then payable to bearer "

gives the transferee the specifically enforceable right to have the unqualified indorsement 

"of the transferor. Negotiation takes place only when the indorsement is made, and until that "


time there is no presumption that the transferee is the owner. 
O.C.G.A. §11-3-201(3) 


"Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee "
"does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee "

2 Negotiable Instruments 


When a security in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a

the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement 


provided. 
"0.C.G.A. §§11-3-201(3), 11-8-307 "


If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a 
"necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the "

provided.

Negotiation is effective to transfer an instrument even though the negotiation is made by an 

"infant or any other person without capacity; or obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake of any "

kind; or part of an illegal transaction; or made in breach of duty. Except as against a 

"subsequent holder in due course, such negotiation is in an appropriate case subject to "

"Negotiation is effective even if obtained from an infant, a corporation exceeding its "
"power, or a person without capacity; or obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake; or in breach of "

"may be rescinded or may be subject to other remedies, but those remedies may not be "
asserted against a subsequent holder in due course or a person paying the instrument in good 


faith and without knowledge of facts that are a basis for recission or other remedy.

Negotiable Instruments 3 


“Holder in due course” means the holder of an instrument if 


1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent 
evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to 
call into question its authenticity and 

2) the holder took the instrument 

"a) for value, "

"b) in good faith, "

c) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that 
there is an uncured fault with respect to payment of another instrument as 
"part of the same series, "

d) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has 
"been altered, "

e) without notice of any claim to the instrument on its proceeds or a claim to 
"rescind the negotiation and recover the instrument or its proceeds, and "

f) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment of the 


obligor against the original payee of the instrument. 
O.C.G.A. §11-3-302(a) 


(The following provisions of O.C.G.A. §11-3-302 may be applicable and should be 
given as required.) 

"Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is "
"not notice of a defense under subsection (a) of section O.C.G.A. §11-3-302, but discharge is "
effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. 
"Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, "
"claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument. "

Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in 


"due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken "


"a) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor’s sale or "


"similar proceeding, "

c) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization. 
0.C.G.A. §11-3-302(c) 


In the event the instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance and 
if the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially 
"performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to "
the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial 


performance divided by the value of the promised performance. 
O.C.G.A. §11-3-302(d) 


If the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the 
"instrument and the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, "
or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security 
"interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due "
course only to an amount payable under the instrument that at the time of enforcement of the 


instrument does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.

46.010 Nuisances; Definition 

"A nuisance is anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another. The fact that "
the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The 
inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful or such as would affect only one of

reasonable person. 


O.C.G.A. §41-1-1 


"46.020 Nuisances; Air, Right to "

Every person has the right to have the air over the person’s premises remain in its natural 
"state and free from artificial impurities, consistent with the locality and character of the "
"community. The pollution of air, as far as reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of life and "


"indispensable to the progress of society, is not actionable. "

"46.030 Nuisances; Reasonable Use of Property, Duty of "

The privilege of use incident to the right of property must not be exercised in an 
unreasonable manner so as to inflict injury upon another unnecessarily. To constitute a 
"nuisance, the use must be such as to produce actual, tangible, and substantial injury to "
neighboring property or such as to interfere sensibly with its use and enjoyment by persons 


of ordinary sensibilities.

48.000 PARTNERSHIP 


48.010 Partnership; Defined 
A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a 
"business for profit (and includes for all purposes of the laws of this state, a limited liability "


partnership). 


O.C.G.A. §14-8-6(a) 


48.020 Partnership; Creation; Generally and as to Third Persons 

"A partnership may be created either by written or oral contract. Joint tenancy, tenancy in "
"common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership "
alone does not establish a partnership but are only factors to consider. The sharing of gross 
"returns alone does not establish a partnership. Sharing of profits of the business, however, is "
prima facie evidence of the existence of a partnership provided that the share was not for a 


payment of the following: 


a) debt; 

"b) wages, salary, or other compensation; "
c) rent; 

d) annuity; 

e) interest or payment on a loan; 


f) consideration for a sale. 


"Except as provided otherwise by law (O.C.G.A.§14-8-16), persons who are not "


partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons. 
O.C.G.A. §14-8-7 


A partnership is a contractual relationship and may result from an express agreement 
that the relationship shall exist or by implication from certain agreements that the parties 
"have made. If the parties, by written or oral contract, expressly agree to become partners, a "
"partnership is created. If they enter into an agreement whereby there is a joint ownership, "


"use, or enjoyment of the profits of undivided property, real or personal, a partnership arises "


"by implication. If two or more persons put into an enterprise property, money, or other "
things of value other than mere personal services upon agreement that they shall each have 
an interest in the profits and that the earnings on the investment shall determine the extent of 
"all profits, if any, to be received, it is a partnership, although no mention may be made as to "


losses.

48.300 Partnership; Employee Distinguished from Partner 

An agreement to pay an employee a share in the profits of a business when the employee has 
no interest in the business as owner or its control or responsibility for its losses does not 
make that employee a partner. The test as to whether two persons are partners is their 
"intention to bind each other (that is, be agents for each other) in connection with a business. "

50.000 PRESCRIPTION 


50.010 Prescription; Definition 
Title by prescription is the right to property that a possessor acquires by reason of the 


continuance of possession for a period of time established by law. 
O.C.G.A. §44-5-160 
"In order for possession to be the foundation of prescriptive title, it must "


"1) be in the right of the possessor and not of another, "

"2) not have originated in actual or positive fraud, "
"(Note: Except as provided in O.C.G.A. §44-5-162, actual or positive fraud and not "
merely constructive or legal.) 

"3) be public, continuous, exclusive, uninterrupted, and peaceable, and "


4) be accompanied by a claim of right. 


"Permissive possession cannot be the foundation of a prescription, until it becomes an "


adverse claim and actual notice to the other party is given. 


O.C.G.A. §44-5-161 


"50.100 Prescription; Possession, Actual "


(See 50.110-50.112.) 


"50.110 Prescription; Possession, Actual; Definition "
"Actual possession of lands may be evidenced by enclosure, cultivation, or any use and "
occupation of the lands that is so notorious as to attract the attention of every adverse 


claimant and so exclusive as to prevent actual occupation by another. 


O.C.G.A. §44-5-165 


"50.111 Prescription; Possession, Actual; Boundaries and Nature "
It is not required that the lot should be enclosed on every side by an artificial enclosure. A 


"natural barrier in part may be utilized, provided it is of such a character as, in connection "


"with a fence, will constitute substantial enclosure of the land and provided it is sufficient to "
indicate possession over the premises and to give notoriety to the claim of possession. When 
"the occupant locates boundaries by visible marks such as chops, blazes, setting up stones, or "
"some other visible manner, and uses the land within them, this action would constitute "
possession. Such possession would be established whenever the boundaries of the occupied 


property can be clearly determined in any way. 


"McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., 179 Ga. 1 (5) (1934) "
"Fitzpatrick v. Massee, 188 Ga. 80 (1939) "


"In order to acquire a prescriptive title by virtue of possession alone for twenty years, "
"such possession must be actual, and the prescription will not extend beyond the limits of "
"actual possession. If one seeks to prescribe by virtue of actual possession alone, one must "


show the extent of such possession. 


"Tillman v. Bomar, 134 Ga. 660(5) (1910) "
"Toms v. Knighton, 199 Ga. 858, 866 (1945) "


"50.112 Prescription; Possession, Actual; Duration "
Possession of real property in conformance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §44-5-161 
"for a period of 20 years, by itself, shall confer or give good title by prescription to the "
property against everyone except the state and those persons laboring under the disabilities 
stated in O.C.G.A. §44-5-170. 

(Note: O.C.G.A. §44-5-170 will not run against rights of [1] minors during their 
"minority, [2] incompetents due to mental illness or retardation, or [3] prisoners during "


imprisonment. )

2 Prescription 


"50.121 Prescription; Possession, Constructive "
(See 50.122—50.125.) 


"50.122 Prescription; Possession, Constructive; Definition; Conflicting Claims "
Constructive possession of land exists when one who has paper title to a tract of land is in 
"actual possession of only a part of the tract. In such a case, that possession shall be construed "
to extend to the boundary of the tract. When land is included in the boundaries of more than 
"one tract so that adjacent owners are in constructive possession of the same land, no "


prescription shall arise in favor of any such owners. 


O.C.G.A. §44-5-166 


"50.123 Prescription; Possession, Constructive; Recorded Deeds; Boundaries "
Possession under a duly recorded deed will be construed to extend to all the contiguous 


property embraced in the deed. 


O.C.G.A. §44-5-167 


"50.124 Prescription; Possession, Constructive; Duration, Fraud, and Forgery "

"Possession of real property, under written evidence of title for seven years, shall confer or "
give good title by prescription to the property against everyone except the state and those 

"persons laboring under disabilities, except that if such written title is forged or fraudulent "

and if the person claiming adverse possession had actual notice of such forgery or fraud 


"when that person commenced possession, no prescription may be based on such possession. "


O.C.G.A. §44-5-164 


"50.125 Prescription; Possession, Constructive; Color of Title "
A color of title is anything in writing connected with the title that serves to define the extent 
"of the claim. It matters not how imperfect or defective the writing, which is considered to be "


"a conveyance, may be if it defines the extent of the claim. "


Prescription 3 


"Street v. Collier, 118 Ga. 470(1) (1903) "
"Rogers v. Manning, 200 Ga. 844-852 (1946) "


It is necessary that the writing relied upon as color of title should describe the 


property or furnish a key for description. 
"McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., 187 Ga. 708-710 (1939) "


The same certainty of description that is necessary to a good deed is necessary to any 


paper that is relied on as color of title. 


"McCrea v. Georgia Power Co., 187 Ga. 708-710 (1939) "
"Crawford v. Verner, 122 Ga. 814, 816 (1905) "


50.200 Prescription; Acquiescence in Line 
"Acquiescence for seven years, by acts or declaration of adjoining land owners, shall "


establish a dividing line. 
O.C.G.A. §44-4-6 


"To establish a line by acquiescence, it must appear that the owners of the property to "
be affected by the establishment of the line either acted in such a manner for a duration of 
seven years or made such declaration during the continuance of that period as to show that 
the line claimed was the true line dividing the properties. Actual possession by the 
"respective owners up to the line may show acquiescence in the line, but such actual "


possession is not necessary to show acquiescence in the line. 


"Tietjen v. Dobson, 170 Ga. 123(3) (1930) "
"Peacock v. Boatright, 221 Ga. 661, 663 (1966) "


50.210 Prescription; Agreed Line 

"An unagreed upon, undetermined, or disputed line between adjoining owners may be "
"established by oral agreement, if the agreement is accompanied by actual possession up to "
the line or is otherwise acknowledged or executed. The agreement may be acknowledged or 


executed by the erection of physical monuments upon the agreed line or by the marking of

"Griner v. Lindsey, 210 Ga. 563, 566 (1954) "


50.220 Prescription; Fraud to Prevent Prescription 

In order for fraud to prevent the possession of property from being the foundation of 
"prescription, such fraud must be actual or positive and not merely constructive or legal. "
"When actual or positive fraud prevents or deters another party from acting, prescription shall "


not continue until such fraud is discovered. 


O.C.G.A. §44-5-162 
"The actual or positive fraud referred to is actual moral fraud, a wrongful act, and not "


an act that the law designates as fraud regardless of good faith. 


"Connell v. Culpepper, 111 Ga. 805 (1900) "
"Ware v. Barlow, 81 Ga. 1 (1887) "


In a suit for land in which the defendant relies upon title by prescription in order to 
"defeat such defense on the ground of fraud, it must appear that the fraud of the alleged "
prescriber was such as would originally affect the conscience and thus amount to actual 


moral wrong. 


"Kelley v. Tucker, 175 Ga. 796(1) (1932) "
"Barfield v. Vickers, 200 Ga. 279, 281 (1946) "


50.300 Prescription; Cotenants 
There may be no adverse possession against a cotenant until the adverse possessor effects an 
"actual ouster and retains exclusive possession; in such event, the cotenant may bring an "


action to recover possession. 
O.C.G.A. §44-6-123 


"When two or more persons own lands jointly, they are known in law as cotenants, "


"and possession of one would constitute possession of all, and there could be no adverse "

52.001 Private Ways; Establishment by Statute (Ways of Necessity) 
(See 52.010-52.020. ) 


52.010 Private Ways; Generally 

"Before one can assert a way of necessity over the land of another, every essential condition "
to such a right must affirmatively appear. Not only must the necessity of entry to and exit 
"from the applicant’s own land exist, but also it must appear that there is no other suitable "
outlet and that the applicant has complied with the provisions of the law as to adequate 
compensation having been paid or tendered to the owner of the land to be subjected to the 


burden of the easement sought. 


"Charleston, etc., Railway Co. v. Fleming, 119 Ga. 995(2) (1904) "
"Miller v. Slater, 182 Ga. 552, 557 (1936) "


(Note: Provisions to O.C.G.A. §§44-9-41-44-9-47 relate to the laying out of ways of 


necessity.) 


52.020 Private Ways; Indispensability 

Cases of necessity contemplated in that provision of the constitution that declares that in 
"cases of necessity, private ways may be granted upon just compensation being first paid do "
not arise except when the way sought to be laid out is absolutely indispensable to the 
applicant as a means of reaching the applicant’s property. If there is in existence a way 
"suitable for all the purposes for which the property is to be used, a case of necessity does not "


"arise, even though such way may be less convenient than the one proposed. "

"Wyatt v. Hendrix, 146 Ga. 143 (1916) "


52.100 Private Ways; Establishment by Prescription 
Whenever a private way has been in constant and uninterrupted use for seven years or more 
"and no legal steps have been taken to abolish it, it shall not be lawful for anyone to interfere "


with that private way. 


O.C.G.A. §44-9-54 
"In order to acquire a prescriptive title to a right-of-way, it must not exceed twenty "
feet in width and those using it must keep it in repair. They cannot acquire a right to a 
greater width by swerving to avoid an obstacle that they themselves should have removed. 
Parts of the way that were over twenty feet wide when originally laid out would not 


necessarily prevent the establishment of a private way. 


"Kirkland v. Pitman, 122 Ga. 256, 260 (1905) "
"Ridley v. Griffeth, 216 Ga. 167 (1960) "

20 feet.) 


52.200 Private Ways; Permissive Use 
"When the use of a private way originates by permission of the owner, prescription does not "
"begin to run until the user notifies the owner, by repairs or otherwise, that the user’s position "


has changed from that of a mere licensee to that of a prescriber.

54.000 PROCESSIONING 


54.010 Processioning; General Rules 

"In cases of disputed land lines, it is the duty of the processioners to fix and determine the "
boundaries as they actually exist. They shall mark anew those lines that can be taken as 
having been formerly located and established and not undertake to locate them as they might 


think they should originally have been laid out. 
"Cosby v. Reid, 21 Ga. App. 604 (1918) "


"In all cases of disputed lines, the following rules shall apply: natural landmarks, "
"being less liable to change and not capable of counterfeit, shall be the most conclusive "
"evidence; ancient or genuine landmarks, such as corner stations or marked trees, shall "
control the course and distance called for by the survey. If the corners are established and 
"the lines not marked, a straight line, as required by the plat, shall be run, but an established "
"marked line, though crooked, shall not be overruled; courses and distances shall be resorted "


to in the absence of higher evidence. 
O.C.G.A. §44-4-5 


The law with respect to the duties of processioners in determining land lines shall 
guide you in determining the case now before the court on a protest filed to the return of the 


processioners. 


54.020 Processioning; Issue 

"On the trial of a protest to the return of processioners, the issue is not title but boundary, "

as was the case before the processioners. The rules of law governing processioners in 
determining the probative value of facts established by the evidence also shall govern you in 


weighing the evidence and determining the issues raised by the protest.

54.030 Processioning; Muniments of Title 

"Muniments, that is, deeds or other written evidence of title accompanied by diagrams or "
"plats that might on paper locate the boundaries of land, will not by themselves be enough to "
mark a line. 

Even though the course and extent of the line may not have been actually marked out 
"upon the earth’s surface, if there should exist enough physically established corners or "
"landmarks, the mere connecting of which by straight lines or from which the projecting of "
"the courses and distances shown by the plat would be enough to complete the boundary, it "
"would be the duty of the processioners to ascertain, mark, and establish the same, respecting "


always the rights under actual possession.

Upon the line of each railway at a point 400 yards from the center of its intersection at grade 
with any public road or street used by the public generally in crossing the tracks of the 
"railway and on each side of the crossing, there shall be erected by the railroad company "
operating the railway a blowpost to indicate the existence of the crossing. The engineer 
operating the locomotive engine of any railroad train moving over the tracks of the railroad 
"shall be required, upon reaching the blowpost, as a signal of approach to the crossing, to "
"blow through the whistle two long blasts, one short blast and one long blast, said blasts to be "
loud and distinct. 

"In addition to these requirements, after reaching the blowpost farthest removed from "
"the crossing and while approaching the crossing, the engineer shall keep and maintain a "
constant and vigilant lookout along the track ahead of the engine and shall otherwise 
exercise due care in approaching the crossing in order to avoid injuring any person or 
property that may be on the crossing or upon the line of the railway at any point within fifty 


feet of the crossing. 


O.C.G.A. §46-8-190 
"Luke v. Powell, 63 Ga. App. 795, 802 (1940) "


The law does not undertake to say what would constitute a constant and vigilant 
lookout nor due care in approaching the crossing. What would constitute a reasonable and 
"substantial compliance with those requirements is a question for you, the jury, to determine "
in light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. A violation of any of the requirements 
"of this code section would constitute negligence, but it would remain for you, the jury, to "

the train to the crossing within the corporate limits by constantly tolling the bell of the 
locomotive. 

The engineer shall keep and maintain a constant and vigilant lookout along the track 
"ahead of the engine while moving within the corporate limits of a city, town, or village and "
shall exercise due care in controlling the movements of the engine or train so as to avoid 
injuring persons or property that may be on the crossing or within fifty feet of the crossing

regulating the speed at which railroad trains may run. 
O.C.G.A. §46-8-191

58.000 SUBROGATION 


58.010 Subrogation; Circumstances Creating Right 
Subrogation is the substitution of another person in the place of the creditor. This other 
"person succeeds to all the rights of the creditor, but subrogation occurs only in certain cases. "


Subrogation arises only in those cases in which 


"a) the party claiming it advanced the money to pay a debt that, in the event of a default "
"by the debtor, the party would have been bound to pay, "

"b) the party has some interests to protect, or "

"c) the party advanced the money under an agreement, express or implied, made either "
with the debtor or creditor that the party would be subrogated to the rights and 


remedies of the creditor.

"Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Alsco Construction Inc. et al., 144 Ga. App. 307, 309 "
-1977


A person who makes an advancement of money in payment of the debts of another 
without any assignment or agreement for subrogation and without any legal obligation to 
make such payment is not entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditors to whom 


payments have been made.

60.000 TORTS 


60.001 Torts Introduction 
The case before you is (a tort case) (one) in which the plaintiff must prove by a 
"preponderance of the evidence that the negligence of the defendant, if any, was a proximate "


cause of the injuries to the plaintiff. 


60.010 Torts; Ordinary Negligence (Ordinary Diligence) 

Ordinary negligence means the absence of or the failure to use that degree of care that is 
used by ordinarily careful persons under the same or similar circumstances. Before a 
"plaintiff can recover damages from a defendant in a case such as this, there must be injury to "


the plaintiff resulting from the defendant’s negligence.

"(See also 60.200, Torts; Promixate Cause; Definition.) "


60.020 Torts; Slight Negligence (Extraordinary Diligence) 

"In general, extraordinary diligence or care is the extreme care and caution that very careful "

that puts other forces in motion or operation resulting in the injury when such other forces 

are the natural and probable result of the act that the defendant committed and that 

reasonably should have been foreseen by the defendant. When the injuries could not 

"reasonably have been foreseen as the natural, reasonable, and probable result of the original "

People are under an obligation to use ordinary care to avoid injuring others after finding 
"them in a dangerous place, regardless of how they got there, and are liable for the failure to "
do so. This rule is known as the Last Clear Chance Doctrine. The Last Clear Chance 
Doctrine only applies when it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
plaintiff(s) placed himself/herself/themselves in danger because of his/her/their own 
"negligence, the defendant actually knew of the plaintiff s (plaintiffs) danger, and the "
defendant had opportunity to take action to avoid the injury to the plaintiff(s) by the use of 
ordinary care under the conditions and circumstances that existed at that time but failed to 
"do so. If you find such to be proved, then the failure of the defendant to use ordinary care "
under such circumstances to avoid the injury to the plaintiff(s) would be considered the 


proximate cause of the plaintiff s (plaintiffs’) injuries.

"While not an insurer of the invitee's safety, the owner/occupier is required to exercise "
ordinary care to protect the invitee from unreasonable risks of harm of which the 
owner/occupier has superior knowledge. The owner/occupier owes persons invited to enter 
the premises a duty of ordinary care to have the premises in a reasonably safe condition and 
not expose the invitees to unreasonable risk (or to lead them into a dangerous trap). The 
"owner/occupier is not required to warrant the safety of all persons from all things, but to "
exercise the diligence toward making the premises safe that a good business person is 
accustomed to use in such matters. The true ground of liability is the owner/occupier's 
superior knowledge of the perilous condition and the danger therefrom to persons coming 
upon the property. It is when the perilous condition is known to the owner and not known to 
the person injured that a recovery is permitted. 

"In order to prevail, the person injured, the plaintiff, must prove by a preponderance "
"of the evidence that the owner/occupier, the defendant, had actual or constructive knowledge "
"of the hazard and that the plaintiff lacked knowledge of the hazard or for some reason, "
"attributable to the defendant, was prevented from discovering it. To establish constructive "
"knowledge, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant or the defendant’s employee was "
in the immediate area of the hazard and could have easily seen the substance or (2) the 
foreign substance remained long enough that ordinary diligence by the defendant or the 
defendant’s employees should have discovered it. Constructive knowledge may be inferred 
"by you, the jury, when there is evidence that the owner lacked a reasonable inspection "
"procedure, but if the plaintiff produces no evidence that the substance could have been "
"discovered during a reasonable inspection, then no inference arises that the defendant's "


failure to discover the defect was the result of any alleged failure to inspect.

A trespasser is one who goes upon private premises without the permission or consent of the

in charge may know that it is that person’s custom to come upon the premises. 

"As a general rule, one is not bound to anticipate the presence of trespassers on "
"private property, and the owner or person in charge of the property owes no duty to keep the "
premises in a condition safe for trespassers who enter without the knowledge of the owner or 
person in charge. 

The owner of the premises owes no duty to a trespasser until after his/her presence is 
actually known and then only owes the trespasser the duty not to willfully or wantonly injure 
him/her.

60.800 Res Ipsa Loquitur 
When something unusual and unexplained happens with respect to a thing or instrumentality 
"over which the defendant has exclusive control, an inference may arise that the injury was "
"due to the defendant’s negligence. The inference may or may not be drawn by you, but in "
any event it would be a question of fact for you to determine under all the surrounding facts 
and circumstances as you find them to have existed at the time and place of the occurrence. 
Should you draw an inference of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur 
"from the manner of the occurrence or the circumstances of the occurrence, the drawing of "
such inference is not necessarily to result in a finding for the plaintiff or to eliminate a 
finding for the defendant. It is your duty to further inquire about whether the inference has 
been overcome by satisfactory explanation. The inference that you may draw from the 
"proved facts is circumstantial evidence only, which you have for consideration along with "
all other evidence in the case. It is your duty to weigh this evidence along with all other 


evidence and determine where the preponderance of evidence lies.

If a physician or surgeon in the treatment and care of a patient should use that degree 
of care and skill ordinarily employed by the profession generally under similar conditions 
"and like surrounding circumstances, then the physician or surgeon would not be negligent; "
"therefore, there could be no finding of malpractice. If, on the other hand, the doctor should "

The presumption in such cases is that the services were performed in an ordinarily 
skillful manner. The person claiming an injury may overcome this legal presumption by 
introducing evidence that the physician (or other medical professionals) did not treat the 
patient in an ordinarily skillful manner. Expert testimony is usually required to overcome the 
"presumption, and the burden is on the one claiming injury to show a lack of due care and "


skill by a preponderance of the evidence. 
"Beach v. Lipham, 276 Ga. 302 (2003) "


In order for the plaintiff to show that the defendant’s alleged negligence was the 
"proximate cause of the plaintiff s injury, the plaintiff must present expert testimony. An "
expert’s opinion on the issue of whether the defendant’s alleged negligence caused the 
plaintiff s injury cannot be based on speculation or possibility. It must be based on 
reasonable medical probability or reasonable medical certainty. If you find that the expert’s 
testimony regarding causation is not based on reasonable medical probability or reasonable 
"medical certainty, then the plaintiff has not proved that the plaintiff’ s injury was proximately "
"caused by the defendant’s alleged negligence, and you would return a verdict for the "

"1) the product was defective, "
"2) the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer’s control, and "

"In determining whether a product was defective, you may consider proof of a manu- "
facturer’s compliance with federal or state safety standards or regulations and industrywide 
"customs, practices, or design standards. Compliance with such standards or regulations is a "

62.680 Defect Due to Inadequate Warning 

A manufacturer has a duty to give an adequate warning of known or reasonably foreseeable 
dangers arising from the use of a product. The manufacturer owes this duty to warn to all 
persons whom the manufacturer should reasonably foresee may use or be affected by the 


product. A manufacturer’s duty to warn may be breached by 


a) failing to provide an adequate warning of the product’s potential dangers or 


b) failing to adequately communicate to the ultimate user the warning provided. 


"A product, however well or carefully made, that is sold without an adequate warning "
of such danger may be said to be in a defective condition. If you find by a preponderance of 
the evidence that the manufacturer did not warn or did not adequately warn when a warning 
"should have been given, then you may find the product to be defective for that reason, and "


the plaintiff is entitled to recover.

62.681 Duty to Warn; Foreseeable and Unforeseeable Uses 
A product that is safe if used in a normal manner is not ordinarily a defective product. If a 
"person uses a product in an abnormal manner and is injured because of such abnormal use, "
"the manufacturer is not liable for such injury. However, if the manufacturer had reason to "
anticipate or foresee that the product might be used in this abnormal manner and that such 
"use might result in injury and, knowing these facts, failed to give adequate warning against "
"using the product in this manner, then the manufacturer may be held liable for the resulting "
injury.

A manufacturer’s duty to warn arises when the manufacturer knows or reasonably should 
"know of the danger presented by the use of a product. Therefore, a manufacturer has a "
continuing duty to adequately warn the public of defects in a product even after that product 


has left the control of the manufacturer to be sold or distributed to the consumer.

Every person has the duty to exercise ordinary care for his/her own safety. If a person 
discovers a product’s defect and is aware of the danger but nevertheless proceeds 
"unreasonably to make use of the product, taking a risk which in and of itself amounts to a "
"failure to exercise ordinary care for his/her safety, he/she cannot later hold another person "
responsible for any injury suffered due to taking such a risk. If you find by a preponderance 


of the evidence that 


"1) the plaintiff knew of the danger posed by the defective product, "

"2) the plaintiff understood and appreciated the risks of that defect, and "

"3) the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposed himself/herself to such a risk, then "

standards of the construction industry are with respect to the improvements made by the 
defendant for the plaintiff. You then must decide whether the defendant’s construction was 
done in a manner that was in conformity with those standards. If you find that the defendant 
"failed to meet industry standards and that the failure resulted in damages to the plaintiff, you "

"order to aid you in coming to a conclusion on that point, (number of) annuity tables are in "
evidence before you. An annuity is a sum a person is entitled to per year during that person’s 
whole life. Sometimes there is a sale of that annuity for which the present cash value of it 
must be determined. An award of damages for permanent loss of earnings amounts to a 
forced sale of lifetime earnings. This table is made to show the present cash value of an 
"annuity, according to the age of the person entitled to an annuity. Turn to that table that is "
before you for the purpose of aiding you in measuring damages for loss of future earnings. 
Take the average annual loss of future income of (plaintiff) (deceased) and the age of the 
(plaintiff) (deceased). You would then consult the annuity tables and find opposite the age 
the present value of an annuity of $1.00 per year for the expected remaining life of a person 
"of that age discounted at the percentage indicated, depending on which you "

An annuity table is based on an average length of life as shown by mortality tables

You do not have to use the annuity table introduced to you in any way. Such a table

"factor is merely something to be considered, without fixing any ultimate test. In the Bulloch "
"Co. case, it is pointed out [p. 247] that the Court of Appeals had unsuccessfully sought "

Phase 1. The jury determines whether or not punitive damages shall be imposed. For 
"nonproduct liability cases, Phase 1A or 2A concerns the nonproduct liability cap special "
"findings, i.e., issues of intent, alcohol, or drugs. It is clear the trial must be bifurcated unless "
stipulated otherwise. There is disagreement on whether the issue of the cap findings should 
be included in the first phase or the second phase. There are practical and possibly tactical 
"reasons to go either way, but no legal guidance. The committee has attempted to offer either "


option.

Phase 2. The trial resumes to receive evidence bearing upon the proper amount to 
"deter, penalize, or punish the defendant. Then, the jury sets the amount of punitive damages "
to be awarded.) 

You have decided to award (impose) punitive damages. Next you must determine the 
"appropriate amount of punitive damages. In doing so, you should consider all the evidence "
"in the first phase of the trial, plus any evidence admitted in the most recent phase of the trial. "
(You should also bear in mind that the plaintiff s injury has been made whole by your award 
"of compensatory damages). The sole purpose of punitive damages is to punish, penalize, or "
"deter the defendant, and the amount you award (impose) should reflect that purpose only. "

(Note: The entire subject of punitive damages seems to be in a state of flux and is 
hotly disputed. These issues must be briefed by counsel and researched by the court. The 
"main benefit of what follows is to acquaint the judge with likely issues and possible, not "
"necessarily approved, charges. Your attention is invited to J. Scalia’s comment in dissent: "
“The punitive damages jurisprudence which has sprung forth from BMW v. Gore is 
"insusceptible of principled application; accordingly, I do not feel justified in giving the case "


stare decisis effect.”’) 


66.741 Punitive Damages; Measure 
The measure of such damages is your enlightened conscience as an impartial jury (but not 
"more than $250,000*) (but not more than /insert ratio range])** to your compensatory "


award). 
O.C.G.A. §51-12-5.1 


(Note: Both parentheticals may or may not be erroneous statements of law but may 
help solve the problem of the proportionality of punitive damage awards identified in the 
supreme court cases. See explanation below.) 

"* Omit cap parenthetical in all product liability cases. In addition, be aware that it "
has been held to be error to tell the jury that a percentage of punitives in certain cases goes 
"to the state. O.C.G.A. §51-12-5.1(e)(2); Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. V. Ford, 278 Ga. App. "
"248; 276 Ga. 226. Although reference to the cap is distinguishable, one could argue that the "


Tort Damages Updated January 2020 17 


cases suggest that it may be error to tell the jury about the cap unless stipulated by both 
parties. There is no guidance at present. 

** Possibly the judge can obtain a range of ratios from a stipulation in a pretrial 
order. State Farm v. Campbell suggests using a “single-digit” ratio or not more than 9-1; 
"and even 9-1 may only be appropriate in an exceptional case. But see Craig v. Holsey, cert. "
"denied 3/29/04 (post State Farm), a Georgia case wherein there was an award of 22-1 ratio. "
"The denial of certiorari is not authority, but the case, though rare, illustrates the difficulty of "


the issue. These precedents may help with the proportionality problem. 


66.750 Punitive Damages; Amount; Guidelines 
(Note: Georgia statutory law does not recognize guidelines for punitive damages. State 
"Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell, 538 US 408; 123 S. Ct. 1513 "
[2003] arises from another state and has not been interpreted in Georgia as of this writing. 
"Procedures and evidence addressed are specific to that case; however, in broad language, "
the opinion addresses and condemns perceived due process problems that occur in many 
"Jurisdictions, including Georgia. The trial judge needs to be aware of its [6-3] holding and "
"the trend that it supports. Much of its language may be dicta, but the case is perceived by "
many to be a bellwether case on punitive damages. The extent of the effect is not known. 

"The guidelines of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell, "
"are written for postjudgment review, but there is strong language suggesting that "
postjudgment review [as has often been relied on in Georgia] may not suffice as a substitute 
for jury guidance and may not be adequate to comply with due process. Punishment without 
"due process [i.e., notice of prohibited conduct and severity of punishment] is the issue, and "
therefore some guidance adjusted to the evidence is probably necessary. The extent of 
"required guidance is not known. Prompted by a very strong trend in U.S. cases, Georgia "
"case law, especially Hospital Authority of Gwinnett Co. V. Jones, has recognized the "
guidelines that follow. Some of these guidelines may conflict with or duplicate those 
suggested in State Farm v. Campbell. Adjustments to the charge have been made 
accordingly. )

but gives no guidance for a charge or other solution. A general sympathy charge has 
been criticized as insufficient. Consider giving a limiting charge on sympathy and 
"prejudice specifically addressing financial circumstances. See 66.773 Bias, "

"counsel well in advance of trial. The committee strongly suggests that the trial judge insist, "
"to the degree practicable, on a “high-low” agreement from counsel and/or a stipulated "

b) the conduct showed an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety 
of others; 

c) the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; 

d) the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; 

"e) the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit (or mere accident) "
(The term “accident” is from the State Farm opinion and may conflict with Georgia 


law; consider substituting “or was merely a consequence not specifically intended. ”’) 
"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell, 538 US 408 (2003) "


"(Note: In addition to reprehensibility, State Farm also identifies two other main "
concerns. The committee can suggest no pattern charge on the other two broad State Farm 
issues. Proportionality is marginally addressed by section number 5 of 66.750 and the 
conclusion in 66.780. There are simply too many variables and unanswered questions for 
this issue to be addressed by a pattern charge. The supreme court declined to adopt a 


"“bright line ratio” and conceded that there is no rigid benchmark. Without more guidance, "


20 Updated January 2020 Tort Damages 


the use of the word “proportional” in a charge may provoke or raise more questions than it 
answers. The issue can perhaps best be addressed if the parties stipulate a proportion 
"range, as suggested. “Penalty comparison” is marginally addressed in charge 66.750. It is "
"not clear how the issue will be presented in evidence to a jury. The trial judge, nevertheless, "


may be called upon to draft a charge on these issues.) 


66.770 Limiting Instructions 

"(Note: Another facet of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell, "
538 US 408; 123 S. Ct. 1513 [2003] is strong criticism of improper jury consideration of 
certain factors in setting the amount of punitive damages. Two factors criticized are 
"punishment for dissimilar conduct and punishment of conduct outside the trial state, with "
"certain exceptions. If there is no evidence of these issues in the case, limiting instructions "
"may be unnecessary. However, they may be a wise precaution. If there is such evidence, "
limiting instructions must be given but may restrict consideration of the evidence for proper 
purposes. The language of limiting charges will likely be hotly disputed. The following are 
starting points only. They should be addressed in pretrial.) 


66.771 Extraterritoriality 
(Note: This is a limiting charge where the jury has heard evidence in Phase I from other 
states.) 

You may have heard evidence of conduct and procedures of the defendant in other 
states that you may properly consider on the issue of intent and reprehensibility. You may 
"not, however, consider for the issue of punitive damages any conduct that was lawful where "
"and when it occurred, nor in other states even though unlawful and which had no impact on "
(the victim) (Georgia and its residents)— 

(State Farm seems to suggest that the safer approach is to use the word “victim.” 
"However, it cites with approval broader language from BMW v. Gore that includes impact "
"on the trial state’s residents. If the parties do not agree in the case on trial, the judge will "
have to choose.) 

(Note: Give the following balancing charge only if there is evidence that conduct 


outside the state contributed to the harm in this case.) 


Tort Damages Updated January 2020 21 


(continued)—unless such conduct in the other state was related to the specific harm 


suffered by the plaintiff in this case. 


"BMW v. Gore, 517 US 559 (1996) "


66.772 Dissimilar Conduct 
(Note: This is a limiting charge where the jury has heard evidence in Phase I of dissimilar 
conduct of the defendant.) 

You may have heard evidence of other conduct and procedures of the defendant. For 
"the purpose of aggravation of punitive damages, you may not consider evidence of any "
conduct of the defendant that is dissimilar to that which resulted in the plaintiff s injury— 

(Note: Give the following balancing charge only if there is evidence that dissimilar 
conduct contributed to the harm in this case.) 

(continued)—unless such dissimilar conduct was related to the specific harm 


suffered by the plaintiff in this case. 


"66.773 Bias, Sympathy, Prejudice "
"(See 02.550, Sympathy.) "

"(Note: The Supreme Court, in State Farm, suggests that a “vague” charge to “avoid "
passion or prejudice” may be inadequate to prevent a likelihood of biased and excessive 
"punishment because of wealth. For that reason, the pattern includes the option of "
"specifically addressing economic status. Give 02.550 Sympathy, including specific "


references to economic or corporate status and possibly residence.) 


66.780 Punitive Damages; Conclusion 
Any award you make should be both reasonable and just in light of your previous award of 
"damages, the conduct and circumstances of the defendant, and the purpose of punitive "


damages.

66.810 Tort Damages; Apportionment of Damages 

If you believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and further find that the plaintiff is to 
"some degree responsible for the injury or damages claimed, you should not make any "
"reduction because of the negligence, if any, of the plaintiff. The court will enter a judgment "
"based on your verdict and, if you find that the plaintiff was negligent in any degree, the court "
in entering judgment will reduce the total amount of damages by the percentage of 
negligence which you attribute to the plaintiff. If you find that the negligence of the plaintiff 
"is equal to or greater than the negligence of the defendant(s), then the plaintiff is not entitled "
to recover damages. 

[Use the following where there is more than one defendant. ] 

If you believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and further find that the damages 
"sustained by the plaintiff were caused by more than one defendant, in determining the total "
"amount of damages to be awarded, if any, you should apportion your award of damages "
among the parties who are liable according to the percentage of fault of each defendant. The 
"court will take into account, in entering judgment against any defendant whom you find to "
"have been negligent, the percentage of that defendant’s negligence compared to the total "
negligence of all the parties to this action. 

[Use the following where there are nonparties on the verdict form. ] 

If you believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and further find that the damages 
"sustained by plaintiff were caused by persons or entities who are not parties to this action, "
you shall consider the fault of all persons or entities whose negligence contributed to the 
"injury or damage. In determining the total amount of damages, you should not make any "


"reduction because of the negligence, if any, of , who is a not a party "





"in this cause of action. The court, in entering judgment, will take into account your "
allocation of negligence among all persons (or entities) who you find contributed to the

66.900 Tort Damages; Chemical Damage to Crops 

"If you believe that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, you should look to the evidence to "
"determine the amount of such damage. In determining such amount, you should consider the "
condition of the crop before the application of the chemical; its stage of development; the 
method of cultivation and husbandry; the probable yield of the crop had it not been 
damaged; its probable value at maturity had it not been damaged; the value of the damaged 
"crop at maturity; and the cost of producing the crop. Considering all these factors, you "
"should award to the plaintiff, if you believe plaintiff is entitled to recover, the difference "
between the net value of the damaged crop at maturity and the net value it would have had if

72.010 Trust Definitions 

“Trust” means a fiduciary relationship with respect to property arising from a settlor’s 
"intention to impose equitable duties on a person to hold, manage, or otherwise administer "
that property for the benefit of another person. “Settlor” means the person who creates the 
trust. The terms “grantor” and “‘trustor” mean the same as “settlor.” “Beneficiary” means a 
person for whose benefit property is held in trust. “Trust instrument” means the document or 
documents that manifest the elements and other details of a trust. “Trust property” means 
property placed in a trust by the settlor or property otherwise transferred to or acquired or 
retained by the trustee for the trust. The terms trust corpus and trust res means the same as 


“trust property.” 


"O.C.G.A. §53-12-2(1), (7), (8), (9), (10), (1) "


"72.100 Trusts, Express and Implied; Definition "

Trusts are either express or implied. “Express trust” means a trust in which the settlor’s 
intention to create the trust is expressly stated and that meets the requirements stated later if 
applicable in this case. “Implied trust” means a trust in which the settlor’s intention to create 
the trust is implied from the circumstances and that meets the requirements stated later if 


applicable to this case. 


"O.C.G.A. §53-12-2(2), (3) "


72.200 Express Trusts; Requirements

to create a trust; (2) trust property; (3) a beneficiary; (4) a trustee; and (5) active duties 


"imposed on the trustee, duties of which may be specified in the writing or implied by law. "
O.C.G.A. §53-12-20 


No formal words are necessary to create an express trust. Words otherwise precatory 


in nature will create a trust only if they are sufficiently imperative to show a settlor’s 


intention to impose enforceable duties on a trustee and if all other elements of an express 


trust are present.

72.300 Implied Trusts; Requirements 
(See 72.310-—72.350.) 


72.310 Implied Trusts; Generally 


An implied trust is either a resulting trust or a constructive trust. 


O.C.G.A. §53-12-90 


72.320 Implied Trusts; Resulting Trust 

A resulting trust is a trust implied for the benefit of the settlor or the settlor’s successors in 
interest when it is determined that the settlor did not intend that the holder of the legal title 
to the trust property also should have the beneficial interest in the property under any of the 


following circumstances: 


"a) a trust is created but fails, in whole or in part, for any reason; "
b) a trust is fully performed without exhausting all the trust property; or 


c) a purchase money resulting trust as defined (below) is established. 


O.C.G.A. §53-12-91 


72.330 Implied Trusts; Purchase Money Resulting Trust 

A purchase money resulting trust is a resulting trust implied for the benefit of the person 
paying consideration for the transfer to another person of legal title to real or personal 
property. Such payment of consideration shall create a presumption in favor of a resulting 
"trust, but this presumption is rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence. However, if the "
"payor of consideration and transferee of the property are husband and wife, parent and child, "
"or siblings, a gift shall be presumed, but this assumption is rebuttable by clear and "


convincing evidence.

Trusts 


"(Note: If this is charged, instructions on “preponderance of the evidence” and "
“clear and convincing evidence” may be needed.) 

"In order to establish the existence of a purchase money resulting trust, one must "
show that such a trust was contemplated by both parties by way of an agreement that is 
"either express or implied by the circumstances or conduct of the parties, and such an "


agreement must have existed at the time the transaction was consummated.

"Ford v. Ford, 243 Ga. 763, 764-765 (1979) "


72.340 Implied Trusts; Constructive Trust 

A constructive trust is trust implied whenever the circumstances are such that the person 
"holding legal title to property, either from fraud or otherwise, cannot enjoy the beneficial "
interest in the property without violating some established principle of equity. The person 
claiming the beneficial interest in the property may be found to have waived the right to a 


constructive trust by subsequent ratification or long acquiescence. 


O.C.G.A. §53-12-93 


72.350 Implied Trusts; Parol Evidence 
"In all cases in which a trust is sought to be implied, the jury may consider oral testimony "
"about the nature of the transaction, the circumstances, and the conduct of the parties either to "


imply or rebut a trust.

obtained by it to the injury of the principal but holds any profits or other benefits gained 


under the relationship as trustee for the use and benefit of the principal.

74.000 UNDUE INFLUENCE 


74.010 Undue Influence; Definition 

Undue influence that voids an otherwise legal contract is the exercise of sufficient control 
over the person to destroy the person’s free will and compel the person to do what would not 
have been done if such control had not been exercised. The undue influence that will annul a 
contract (deed) must be of that potency that substitutes somebody else’s willpower for that 


of the maker (grantor).

"Because the free assent of the parties is essential to a valid contract, duress by imprisonment, "
"threats, or other acts by which the free will of the party is restrained and his/her consent is "
induced will render the contract voidable at the election of the injured party. Legal 


"imprisonment, if not used for illegal purposes, is not duress. "

"74.110 Undue Influence; Duress; Harm, Threats of "

Duress is considered as a species of fraud in which compulsion in some form takes the place 
"of deception in accomplishing an injury and, like fraud, constitutes a meritorious ground to "
set aside a contract executed as a result thereof. Duress that will avoid a contract must 
"consist of illegal imprisonment, legal imprisonment used for an illegal purpose, threats of "
"bodily or other harm, or other means amounting to coercion or tending to coerce the will of "
another and actually inducing him/her to do an act contrary to his/her free will. The threats 


must be sufficient to overcome the mind and will of a person of ordinary firmness.

74.120 Undue Influence; Duress; Economic Duress 

Economic duress is a form of the duress recognized (in the law). Business compulsion or 
economic duress involves the taking of undue or unjust advantage of a person’s economic 
necessity or distress to coerce him into making a contract and is also recognized as a 
"contractual defense. However, a duress claim of this nature must be based upon acts or "
conducts of the opposite party that are wrongful or unlawful. When the signer is 
"sophisticated in business matters and has access to and in fact obtains advice of counsel, the "
defense of duress is not available to void the contract. One may not void a contract on 
"grounds of duress merely because he entered into it with reluctance, the contract is very "
"disadvantageous to him, the bargaining power of the parties was unequal, or there was some "
unfairness in the negotiations preceding the agreement. (Add the following if waiver is 
"properly raised as a defense.) (Moreover, even if acts could otherwise have been construed "


"as sufficient duress to void a note, reliance upon the defense of duress may be waived.) "

"purpose or threats of bodily or other harm, or other means amounting to coercion or "
"tending to coerce the will of another, and actually inducing the person to do an act contrary "
"to his/her own free will.” King v. Lewis, 188 Ga. 597 [1939]. There is apparently no further "
statute on the subject except O.C.G.A. §13-5-6. The only provision on this subject in the 
"Uniform Commercial Code, which repealed former Ga. Code Ann. §96-209, is O.C.G.A. "

76.000 WILLS 


(Note: There was a major revision of the probate code in 1998. Probate or validity of the 
will is usually appealed from probate court to superior court rather than appealed 
"concerning the construction of a will. Therefore, the charges that follow focus on this "
"difference. Also, since usually “the construction of a will is a question of law for the court,” "
"Bennett v. Young, 270 Ga. 422 [1999]. Rather than a jury issue, this issue is not easily or "
often aptly addressed by the charges.) 


"76.010 Wills; Generally, Definitions "

“Will” means the legal declaration of an individual’s testamentary intention regarding that 
"individual’s property or other matters. That is, a will is the legal declaration of a person’s "
intention as to the disposition of property or other matters after the person’s death. A will 
includes the will and all codicils to the will. “Codicil” means an amendment to or 
"republication of a will. ““Testator’ means a person who has made a will, especially a person "
"who dies leaving a will. “Beneficiary” means a person, including a trust, who is designated "
in a will to take an interest in real or personal property. “Executor” means any person 
"nominated in a will who has qualified to administer a testate estate, including a person "


nominated as alternative or successor executor.

"of the definition of “testator”; also see Dean’s v. Deans, 171 Ga. 664 (1931). "


76.011 Wills; Determination Whether Instrument Is a Will 

No particular form is necessary to constitute a will. To determine whether an instrument is a 
"will, the test is the intention of the maker to be gathered from the whole instrument, read in "
"light of the surrounding circumstances. If the intention is to convey a present interest, even "
"though the possession is postponed until after death, the instrument is not a will. If the "
"intention is to convey an interest accruing and having effect only at death, the instrument is "


a will. 


O.C.G.A. §53-4-3 


76.012 Wills; Power of Testator 
"A testator, by will, may make any disposition of property that is not inconsistent with the "
"laws or contrary to the public policy of the state and may give all the property to strangers, "


to the exclusion of the testator’s spouse and descendants.

action. 

(An individual who has been convicted of a crime shall not be deprived of the power 


to make a will.)

76.110 Wills; Testamentary Capacity; Decided and Rational Desire; Incapacity 
to Contract; Insanity; Advanced Age or Eccentricity 
Testamentary capacity exists when the testator has a rational desire as to the disposition of 
property. An incapacity to contract may coexist with the capacity to make a will. An insane 
individual generally may not make a will except during a lucid interval. A monomaniac may 
"make a will if the will is in no way connected with the monomania. In all such cases, it must "
appear that the will expresses the wishes of the testator unbiased by the insanity or 
monomania with which testator is affected. Neither advancing age nor weakness of intellect 


nor eccentricity of habit or thought is inconsistent with the capacity to make a will. 


O.C.G.A. §53-4-11 


76.120 Wills; Testamentary Capacity; Freedom of Volition 

A will must be freely and voluntarily executed. A will is not valid if anything destroys the 
"testator’s freedom of volition, such as fraudulent practices upon the testator’s fears, "
"affections, or sympathies; misrepresentations; duress; or undue influence whereby the will "


of another is substituted for the wishes of the testator.

A will shall be in writing and shall be signed by the testator or by some other individual in 
the testator’s presence and at the testator’s express direction. A testator may sign by mark or 
by any name that is intended to authenticate the instrument as the testator’s will. A will shall 
be attested and subscribed in the presence of the testator by two or more competent 
witnesses. A witness to a will may attest by mark. Another individual may not subscribe the 
"name of a witness, even in that witness’s presence and at that witness’s direction. A codicil "
shall be executed by the testator and attested and subscribed by witnesses with the same 


formality as a will.

presumed to show such knowledge. 


O.C.G.A. §53-4-21

witness shall not prevent the probate of the will.

A revocation may be express or implied. An express revocation occurs when the testator by 
writing or action expressly annuls a will. An express revocation takes effect instantly. 

An implied revocation results from the execution of a subsequent inconsistent will 
that does not by its terms expressly revoke the previous will. An implied revocation takes 
effect only when the subsequent inconsistent will becomes effective. If the subsequent

"there is no surviving spouse, in the children, share and share alike, and the property shall not "
be administered as the estate of the deceased spouse or parent. When property is set apart as 
"a year’s support for the benefit of the surviving spouse alone, the spouse shall thereafter own "
"the same in fee, without restriction as to use, encumbrance, or disposition. However, if the "
"decedent leaves minor children by different spouses, the jury shall specify the portion going "
"to the children of the former spouse or spouses, which shall be vested in those children. "
"Moreover, if the decedent leaves minor children and the surviving spouse is the parent of the "
"minor children, the jury may in its discretion specify separate portions for the minor children "
"and the surviving spouse, if the jury deems the award of separate portions to be in the best "
"interests of the parties, and the portions shall vest separately in the surviving spouse and the "


children.
