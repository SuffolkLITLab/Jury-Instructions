    <h1>Georgia Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>[Preamble describing the nature of this annotated presentation]</p>
<hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.000' href='# 00.000'></a> 00.000</h4><p> Evidence; Note Regarding Changes Based upon New Evidence Code      (Introduction—Georgia Law 2011, p. 99, which adopted the new evidence code, (the   Georgia version of the Federal Rules) included, in pertinent part, the following preamble:   “Tt is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this Act to adopt the Federal   Rules of Evidence, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States and the United   States circuit courts of appeal as of January 1, 2013 to the extent that such interpretation is   consistent with the Constitution of Georgia. Where conflicts were found to exist among the   decisions of the various circuit courts of appeal interpreting the federal rules of evidence,      the General Assembly considered the decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . The             General Assembly is cognizant that there are many issues regarding evidence that are not   covered by the Federal Rules of Evidence and in those situations the former provisions of   Title 24 have been retained. Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the   General Assembly intends that the substantive law of evidence in Georgia as it existed on      December 31, 2012 be retained.” [emphasis added]             Consistent with the foregoing, the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee has reviewed   all old charges on evidence and made changes keeping in mind the new rules and added   other refinements we felt were needed. Some old charges were retained even where   underlying statutes have been repealed or replaced. In most such instances, it was felt the   old charge could do no harm. The committee has also taken some charges from the I 1th      Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions we felt were clearer and complied with Georgia Law.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='Kansas.html#121.01'>121.01</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#121.08'>121.08</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#132.09'>132.09</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a> (97%); <a href='Kansas.html#121.88'>121.88</a> (97%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.005' href='# 00.005'></a> 00.005</h4><p>  (Civil): Before Introduction   of Evidence   (Note: Preliminary instructions are optional and are included in this charge book for use by   those judges who feel they would be helpful to jurors. Many judges use some form of   preliminary instructions because they feel it assists jurors in understanding their   responsibility and the order of trial proceedings.   Care should be taken to ensure that all parties are present during these and all jury      instructions unless the record shows a waiver. This practice has been approved by the      appellate courts in Bradham v. State, 148 Ga. App. 89[6] [1978], even in the absence of the   defendant, Oliver v. State, 168 Ga. App. 477[4] at 478 [1983].)     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <a href='Kansas.html#101.01'>101.01</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#102.50'>102.50</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#102.01'>102.01</a> (98%); <a href='Kansas.html#101.11'>101.11</a> (98%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 00.010' href='# 00.010'></a> 00.010</h4><p> Generally      Members of the jury, the case you are about to try is styled .
