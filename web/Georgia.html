Where conflicts were found to exist among the   decisions of the various circuit courts of appeal interpreting the federal rules of evidence,      the General Assembly considered the decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . The             General Assembly is cognizant that there are many issues regarding evidence that are not   covered by the Federal Rules of Evidence and in those situations the former provisions of   Title 24 have been retained. Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the   General Assembly intends that the substantive law of evidence in Georgia as it existed on      December 31, 2012 be retained.” [emphasis added]             Consistent with the foregoing, the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee has reviewed   all old charges on evidence and made changes keeping in mind the new rules and added   other refinements we felt were needed. Some old charges were retained even where   underlying statutes have been repealed or replaced. In most such instances, it was felt the   old charge could do no harm. The committee has also taken some charges from the I 1th      Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions we felt were clearer and complied with Georgia Law.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#121.01'>121.01</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#121.08'>121.08</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#132.09'>132.09</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#121.88'>121.88</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.005' href=' 00.005'> 00.005</a></h4><p>  (Civil): Before Introduction   of Evidence   (Note: Preliminary instructions are optional and are included in this charge book for use by   those judges who feel they would be helpful to jurors. Many judges use some form of   preliminary instructions because they feel it assists jurors in understanding their   responsibility and the order of trial proceedings.   Care should be taken to ensure that all parties are present during these and all jury      instructions unless the record shows a waiver. This practice has been approved by the      appellate courts in Bradham v. State, 148 Ga. App. 89[6] [1978], even in the absence of the   defendant, Oliver v. State, 168 Ga.

Under our legal             system, it is my duty as the trial judge to determine the law applicable to this case, and it is   your duty, as the jury, to determine the facts of the case. It is also your duty to apply the law      to those facts in reaching your verdict.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.30'>101.30</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.20'>101.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.12'>101.12</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.020' href=' 00.020'> 00.020</a></h4><p> Evidence     You determine the facts from the evidence, which consists of two things: testimony and   exhibits. Testimony is the statements that you will hear made under oath from the witness(es).   Exhibits are documents, photos, or other items that will be admitted into evidence. You will   then have those exhibits with you in the jury room for use during your deliberations.     I caution you that what the lawyers say during this trial is not evidence. Nothing they   say in their opening statements or their arguments or at any other time during this trial is   evidence. Nor is anything I might do or say evidence in this case.     I have no leanings in this case whatsoever. My interest in this case is to see that it is   tried fairly for both parties and to see that it is tried according to the laws of the State of      Georgia and according to the constitutions of this state and of the United States.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.03'>102.03</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.12'>101.12</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.030' href=' 00.030'> 00.030</a></h4><p> Parties (Optional)   You must consider this case as a lawsuit between persons of equal worth and equal standing   in the community and between persons holding the same or similar positions in life. All   persons stand equal before the law, and all persons are to be dealt with as equals in a court   of justice.

The plaintiff   must prove this case by what is known as a “preponderance of the evidence.”     The term “preponderance” means “greater weight,” and as it is used here,   “preponderance of the evidence” means “the greater weight of evidence upon the issues   involved.” The weight of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a   reasonable doubt. However, to be a preponderance, the weight of the evidence must be   sufficient to incline a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to   the other.     (Give the following portion of this charge if an affirmative defense is asserted:     The defendant has filed what is/are known as [an] affirmative defense[s] to the      claim[s] of the plaintiff, specifically [state the affirmative defense(s) asserted]. As to             that/those defense[s], the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of   the evidence.)   If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it would then   be your duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue.

Souther, 274 Ga.   61 [2001].)     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#102.10'>102.10</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.05'>181.05</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.21'>191.21</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#130.22'>130.22</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.73'>102.73</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.050' href=' 00.050'> 00.050</a></h4><p> Credibility of Witnesses   The jury must determine the credibility, or believability, of the witnesses. Therefore, you   must determine which witness or witnesses you will believe and which you will not believe,   if there are any whom you do not believe.     In determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies and the credibility of      witnesses, you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case. You may consider      1) the witnesses’ manner of testifying,     2) their intelligence,     3) their means and opportunity for knowing the facts about which they testify,   4) the nature of the facts about which they testify,      5) the probability or improbability of their testimony,             6) their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and      7) their personal credibility as it appears from the trial.      It is your duty to determine what testimony is worthy of belief and what testimony   is not worthy of belief. You may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of   any witness.     You may also consider the number of witnesses, but the preponderance of evidence      does not necessarily lie with the party who has the greater number of witnesses.

During the course of this trial there may   be objections made by the lawyers and rulings made by the court. These objections and   rulings will involve the technical rules of evidence, and you should draw no inferences and   make no assumptions from either the lawyer’s objections or the court’s rulings. Evidence      that is not admitted because of an objection or other reason shall not be considered by you.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.03'>102.03</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.20'>101.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.21'>191.21</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.080' href=' 00.080'> 00.080</a></h4><p> Trial Procedure   The procedure used in a civil trial is generally as follows:     First, the attorney for each side has the opportunity to address you in what is called   an opening statement. This opening statement itself is not evidence. Remember that what the   lawyers say is not evidence but rather is a preview or outline of what they expect the   evidence to be. Since the plaintiff has the burden of proof, the plaintiff goes first.     Following the opening statements, the plaintiff presents evidence; that is, the plaintiff   calls witnesses and introduces any exhibits. The defendant has the right to cross-examine   these witnesses. When the plaintiff has presented all of his/her evidence, the plaintiff will   rest his/her case.     The defendant then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means that the   defendant then calls witnesses and introduces exhibits. The plaintiff has the right to cross-      examine the defendant’s witnesses.              After all of the evidence has been presented, the attorneys have the opportunity to   make what is called a closing argument or a summation. At that time, the attorneys will   attempt to point out to you certain parts of the evidence that they think are favorable to their   position and try to persuade you to decide the case in their favor. Both sides have the   opportunity to make this closing argument.     Following the closing arguments, I will charge you more specifically on the law   directly applicable to this case. I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and   reach your verdict.     Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the   evidence. Do not jump to conclusions before all of the evidence is presented. Also, please   remember that during the course of this trial, it would be improper for you to discuss this   case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the case with you or in your presence or   hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in the jury room or elsewhere before      actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence of all twelve of you.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.30'>101.30</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.08'>102.08</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.21'>191.21</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.090' href=' 00.090'> 00.090</a></h4><p> Note Taking by Jurors     Regarding juror note taking: I have asked the bailiff to provide you with pencils and note   pads for your use during trial. You may take notes, but you are not required to do so. If you   decide to take notes, please remember that note taking should not divert you from paying   full attention to the evidence and evaluating witness credibility. Your observations of the   witnesses during their testimony can be vital to your determination of the believability of   their testimony. The notes that you take are for your use only and are not to be shared with   anyone until you begin deliberation with your fellow jurors. Notes are not evidence, only   memory aids, and should not take precedence over your recollection. It is the duty of each   juror to recall the evidence, and while you may consider another juror’s notes to refresh your   memory, you should rely on your own recollection of the proceedings. Do not be influenced   by the notes of other jurors, unless their notes help you in determining your own   independent recollection. Notes are not entitled to any greater weight than the recollection or   impression of each juror as to what the evidence may have been. After the trial is over, the      notes will be collected and destroyed.             United States v. Rhodes, 631 F.2d 43 (5th Cir.) (1980)   United States v. D. R. McLean, 578 F.2d 64 (3rd Cir.)

You may   not visit any scenes depicted by the evidence. You may not utilize any books or documents   not in evidence during your deliberations. You may not read or listen to any accounts of the   trial that might appear in the news media. You may not discuss this case with anyone,   including your fellow jurors, until the court authorizes you to do so.     That concludes my preliminary instructions, and we are now ready for the lawyers to      give their opening statements.             <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.12'>101.12</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.08'>102.08</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.03'>102.03</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.110' href=' 00.110'> 00.110</a></h4><p> Juror Use of Electronic Technology to Conduct Research on or   Communicate about a Case   (Before Trial: )     To preserve the integrity of the jury system, you as finders of facts must decide this   case solely upon evidence presented in this courtroom. This means that during the trial, you   must not conduct any independent research about this case, the matters in the case, and the   individuals or corporations involved in the case. In other words, you should not consult   dictionaries or reference materials; search the Internet, websites, or blogs; or use any other   electronic tools to obtain information about this case or to help you decide the case. Please   do not try to find out information from any source outside the confines of this courtroom—   to include media of any sort or online legal research. Until you retire to deliberate, you may   not discuss this case with anyone, even your fellow jurors. After you retire to deliberate, you   may begin discussing the case with your fellow jurors, but you cannot discuss the case with   anyone else until you have returned a verdict and the case is at an end. I hope that for all of   you this case is interesting and noteworthy. I know that many of you use cell phones,   Blackberries, the Internet, and other tools of technology. You also must not talk to anyone   about this case or use these tools to communicate electronically with anyone about the case.   This includes your family and friends. You may not communicate with anyone about the   case on your cell phone, through e-mail, Blackberry, iPhone, text messaging, or on Twitter;   through any blog or website; through any Internet chat room; or by way of any other social      networking websites, including Facebook, My Space, LinkedIn, and YouTube.      (At the Close of the Case:)     During your deliberations, you must not communicate with or provide any   information to anyone by any means about this case. You may not use any electronic device   or media, such as a telephone, cell phone, smart phone, iPhone, Blackberry, or computer; the   Internet, any Internet service, or any text or instant messaging service; or any Internet chat   room, blog, or website such as Facebook, My Space, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Twitter to   communicate to anyone any information about this case or to conduct any research about      this case until I accept your verdict.            <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.12'>101.12</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.50'>102.50</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#102.01'>102.01</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 02.000' href=' 02.000'> 02.000</a></h4><p> GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS     <h4><a name=' 02.010' href=' 02.010'> 02.010</a></h4><p> Pleadings     You have been considering the case of (name of plaintiff), as Plaintiff, v.

Evidence includes all of the testimony of the witnesses as well as the exhibits   admitted during the trial. (It also includes any stipulations, which are facts agreed to by the   attorneys.)     Evidence may be either direct or circumstantial or both.     In considering the evidence, you may use reasoning and common sense to make   deductions and reach conclusions. “Direct evidence” is the testimony of a person who   asserts that he or she has actual knowledge of a fact (such as an eyewitness) (such as by   personally observing or otherwise witnessing that fact). “Circumstantial evidence” is proof   of [a chain or set of] facts and/or circumstances that tend to prove or disprove another fact   by inference (that is, by consistency with such fact or elimination of other facts).

Direct evidence is evidence that immediately points to the question at issue.             Circumstantial (or indirect) evidence is evidence that only tends to establish a fact; it   must be such as to reasonably establish that fact rather than anything else. The comparative   weight of circumstantial and direct evidence on any given issue is a question of fact for you      to decide.      Scott v. State, 57 Ga. App. 489 (1938)   O.C.G.A. §24-14-6      (The following are alternative charges as to evidence.)     Direct evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts to   which the witness testifies and that, if believed, is sufficient to prove or establish these facts.     Circumstantial evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts   to which the witness testifies, from which such facts, if believed, you may find other facts to   exist, that are reasonable and believable to you in the light of your experience.     When circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish a fact or theory, it must be      such as to reasonably establish that fact or theory rather than anything else.      Scott v. State, 57 Ga.

Testimony has been given in this case by certain witnesses who are termed experts. Expert   witnesses are those who because of their training and experience possess knowledge in a   particular field that is not common knowledge or known to the average citizen. The law      permits expert witnesses to give their opinions based upon that training and experience.             You are not required to accept the testimony of any witnesses, expert or otherwise.   Testimony of an expert, like that of all witnesses, is to be given only such weight and credit      as you think it is properly entitled to receive.      O.C.G.A. §§24-7-702—24-7-705   McCoy v.

State, 293 Ga. App. 350 (2) (2008);   however, the Federal Rules re-codify it. O.C.G.A. §24-14-4. Query: What if the defense   brings in a world-renowned DNA expert who is a certified genius to testify versus a seeming   bureaucratic “expert for the state,” and the defense requests the charge including   intelligence? The cases prohibiting the use of “intelligence” in charge are a seeming   egalitarian knee-jerk against correlating intelligence and honesty. But credibility also may   depend on competency. The charge is neutrally drawn and can be adequately argued by   either side.     The jury must determine the credibility of the witnesses. In deciding this, you may   consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the witnesses’ manner of   testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts about which      they testify, the nature of the facts about which they testify, the probability or improbability        General Instructions      of their testimony, their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and their      personal credibility as you observe it.

One of your first duties in the jury room will be to select   one of your number to act as foreperson, who will preside over your deliberations and who   will sign the verdict to which all twelve of you freely and voluntarily agree.     You should start your deliberations with an open mind. You should carefully   consider all of the evidence in the case and deliberate with an aim toward reaching a   unanimous verdict consistent with your consciences and oaths as jurors. Avoid premature,   fixed opinions. Consult with one another and consider each other’s views. Each of you must   decide this case for yourself, but you should do so only after discussion and consideration of   the case with your fellow jurors. Do not hesitate to change an opinion if convinced that it is   wrong. However, you should never surrender honest convictions or opinions in order to be   congenial or to reach a verdict solely because of the opinions of the other jurors.     You may go now to the jury room, but do not begin your deliberations until I send   you the pleadings, exhibits, and verdict form, which I will do shortly.

You have been deliberating this case for a considerable   length of time, and the court deems it proper to advise you further in regard to the   desirability of agreement if possible.     The case has been exhaustively and carefully tried by both sides. It has been   submitted to you for decision and verdict, if possible, rather than for disagreement. It is the   law that a unanimous verdict is required. While this verdict must be the conclusion of each   juror and not a mere acquiescence in order to reach an agreement, it is still necessary for all   the jurors to examine the issues and questions submitted with candor and fairness and with a   proper regard for, and deference to, the opinion of the others.     Each juror should listen to the arguments of other jurors with a disposition to be   convinced by them. If you differ in your views of the evidence, such difference of opinion   should cause you to scrutinize the evidence more closely and to reexamine the grounds of   your opinions.     Your duty is to decide the issues of fact that have been submitted to you, if you can   do so conscientiously. In conferring, you should lay aside all mere pride of opinion and   should bear in mind that the jury room is no place to champion either side of a cause. As   jurors, you should not be advocates. The aim to keep in mind is the truth as it appears from   the evidence, examined in light of the court’s instructions.     You will again retire to your jury room for a reasonable time and examine your      differences in a spirit of fairness and try to arrive at a verdict.      Spaulding v.

It says in      substance that plaintiff has taken (title to) (an easement for purpose over) a             described tract of defendant’ s land (and, if applicable, in a highway condemnation), together      with slope and drainage easements.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#127.52'>127.52</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#127.80'>127.80</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#124.71'>124.71</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#126.04'>126.04</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#105.04'>105.04</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 14.020' href=' 14.020'> 14.020</a></h4><p> Condemnation; Issue     Under the law and under the constitution of this state, plaintiff has the right to take (or   damage) private property for a public purpose, provided that it pays just and adequate   compensation for the property taken. The only question is, “What constitutes just and   adequate compensation for the property taken?” By “property,” I mean all property rights of   any kind. Property rights are determined as of the date plaintiff condemned the rights, which      is (the date the condemning authority tenders or pays the money).      Ga. Const. 1983, art. I, sec.

While the burden of proof is upon the condemning authority, the owner of the   property is also allowed to offer evidence upon the issues involved, and you must determine      the issues in the case by the preponderance of the evidence as you find it to be.

This measure of   consequential damages should be made as of the date of taking. Another way of stating the   proper measure of consequential damages to the remainder of the owner’s property is the   decrease, if any, in the fair market value of this remainder in its circumstance just prior to   the time of the taking compared with its fair market value in its new circumstance just after      the time of the taking.

In determining the amount of consequential damages, if any, you should consider   whether the condemnation will benefit the land the owner has left and, if so, reduce the   consequential damage by that amount. The reduced amount is the consequential damage.   However, consequential benefits must be disregarded to the extent that they exceed   consequential damages; that is, consequential benefits to the remaining property may be   shown only as an offset against consequential damages, not as an offset against the value of      land actually taken or used.

A special benefit would be something that adds   to the convenience, accessibility, or usefulness of the property affected by the   condemnation. It could benefit the properties of other individuals and still be a special   benefit within the meaning of condemnation law.

A person      ordinarily has the right of access to a public road or highway that goes through the person’s       August 2020 Condemnation      property; that is, the right to go on or off the highway from or to the property, which is a   property right and for which the person is entitled to be paid if a condemnation takes away   that right. These rights do not pertain to limited-access highways, and the owner is not   entitled to such payments for the lack or absence of access rights.     (The next provision refers to interference with access to an existing road or highway   and should be charged only if applicable to the facts.)     If the construction of a limited-access highway interferes with the owner’s access   right, the owner’s right of access to an existing road would have to be taken into account,      condemned, and included in the owner’s compensation for land actually taken.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#131.11'>131.11</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#131.16'>131.16</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#121.17'>121.17</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#126.32'>126.32</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.31'>191.31</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 14.400' href=' 14.400'> 14.400</a></h4><p> Condemnation; Leased Property     In determining the damages for the condemnation of land that is being leased, you would   need to determine both the amount of damages to the lessor (that is, the owner) and to the   lessee (that is, the person it is being leased to). Ordinarily, the total amount of such damage   would not exceed the total fair market value of the land. The measure of damages to the   lessee (the person it is being leased to) would ordinarily be the market value of the lease to   the lessee (the person leasing it), less the amount of rent payable under the lease. The   remaining value of the lease to the lessor (owner) would ordinarily be its rental value to   him/her/it for the period of the lease, plus the value of the reversion or the value of   his/her/its future interest after the lease has ended.     If there are special damages, such as loss of profits and business or expenses for   removal of business or other matters that would make the fair market value test inadequate,   you would consider these matters in addition to the fair market value of the land in   determining what is just and adequate compensation for the lessor and the lessee.     Business losses are recoverable as a separate item of damages only if you believe      from the evidence that the property involved is unique.      MARTA v. Ply-Marts Inc., 144 Ga.

Unique property is property that must be valued by something other than the fair   market value standard.

Southern Railway Co., 245 Ga. 229 (1980)      If the property is unique and the business belongs to the landowner, total destruction   of the business or permanent business loss at the location condemned must be proved before      business losses may be recovered as separate damages.

The original contract will be suspended by the   departure until such notice.     In order for this rule to have application, it is necessary that the circumstances be   such as will in law imply a mutual new agreement whereby new, distinct, and definite terms   are supplied in lieu of those provided for by the original contract. The departure from the   terms of the contract must have been substantial and such as to make it inequitable for the   creditor to demand without previous notice all past-due payments or to proceed to collect by   suit. Evidence of the buyer’s repeated, late, irregular payments, which were accepted by the   person to whom payment was due, is a factor for your consideration in determining whether      anew mutual agreement is to be implied.

If a statement of an account   is rendered to the debtor and the debtor fails to object to it, the jury may be authorized to   infer that the failure to raise any objections was an implied agreement that the account was   correct, but this inference is not demanded as a matter of law.     A promise to pay may be either express or implied, but a failure to object to an   account rendered does not require the jury to infer a promise to pay from mere acquiescence      in the correctness of the amount.   Shores-Mueller Company v. Bell, 21 Ga. App. 194, 195 (1917)      While such a failure to object may be considered by the jury, it is not to be regarded   as final proof but only a means of proof having evidentiary value, and it is subject to      explanation and denial by other evidence.   Elliott v. National Union Radio Corporation, 68 Ga. App. 873, 876 (1943)      Whether any explanation or denial is sufficient is a matter for the jury to determine,   keeping in mind that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. The jury may find that the failure   of the defendant to object within a reasonable time to a statement of account shifts to the   defendant the burden of going forward with the evidence or an unfavorable inference may   be made regarding the defendant’s testimony. No inference would be drawn from the   rendering of a statement of account by the plaintiff if the defendant gave timely objections to   any inaccuracies found in the statement or if the defendant has satisfactorily explained the   failure to so object.     If you find that there has been no acknowledgment and oral promise to pay, either      expressed or implied, the rules relating to an account stated simply would not apply, and you      10 Contracts      would then resolve the issue based upon the rule that in order to recover, the plaintiff must      prove the correctness of the account and the liability of the defendant to pay it.

We have included cross-references to the civil charge   book to facilitate incorporation of other standard charges as appropriate.     For cases that do not involve child support, charge the appropriate parts of Sections 22.000   only.

Consider a jury trial   procedure where assets and alimony are decided first because those verdicts may impact the   jury’s decision on child support issues. However, where periodic alimony is being requested   and child support is an issue, it makes sense for the jury to determine child support first, so     they know much of the obligor’s income is available to satisfy a periodic alimony award.

Members of the jury, you are about to try the case of      DA . You will be                    deciding whether (is/are) entitled to a divorce (note: this may not be   an issue if both parties agree to the divorce in the complaint and counterclaim). You will   (also) be deciding issues incidental to divorce such as equitable division of property (and   alimony) (and child support). Under Georgia law, it is my duty as the trial judge to   determine the law applicable to this case, and it is your duty, as the jury, to determine the   facts of the case. It is also your duty to apply the law to those facts in reaching your verdict.     The facts are determined by you from the evidence. The evidence consists of two   things: testimony and exhibits. Testimony is evidence which you will hear under oath from   the witness(es). Exhibits are documents or photos or other items that have been admitted into   evidence. You will have those exhibits with you in the jury room for your use during your   deliberations.     I caution you that nothing the lawyers or I say during this trial is evidence. Nothing   the attorneys say in their opening statements, closing arguments, or during the trial is      evidence, nor is anything I do or say evidence. I have no leanings in this case whatsoever.      (At the beginning of the trial, you will be given various forms such as financial      affidavits and child support calculation schedules of either or both parties. I instruct you that        Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony      these forms are not evidence but are the contentions of the parties in the format required by   law. These forms are not to be considered by you as evidence until and unless and to the   extent they are supported by admissible evidence, such as by testimony or by other admitted   exhibits [or unless the figures of both parties coincide, which you may regard as a stipulation      of fact]).      My interest in this case is to see that the case is tried fairly as to both parties and to   see that it is tried according to the laws of the State of Georgia and according to the      Constitutions of this State and of the United States.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.20'>101.20</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.21'>191.21</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.12'>101.12</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.030' href=' 00.030'> 00.030</a></h4><p> Parties (Optional)   In a divorce case such as this, each party has a claim against the other. Each party has the   burden of proving entitlement to that which he/she seeks. Each party must prove his/her      respective case by what is known as a preponderance of the evidence.      The term preponderance means greater weight, and as it is used here, preponderance   of the evidence means the greater weight of evidence upon the issues involved. The weight   of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a reasonable doubt, but to   be a preponderance of the evidence, the weight of the evidence must be sufficient to incline      a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to the other.      If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it is your   duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue.     The procedure followed in a divorce trial is generally as follows: First, the attorneys   for both sides have the opportunity to make an opening statement to you. This opening   statement is not evidence. Remember that what the lawyers say is not evidence. An opening   statement is a preview or an outline of what they expect the evidence to show. Following the   opening statements, one party presents evidence; that is, one party calls witnesses and   introduces any exhibits they may have. The other party has the right to cross-examine these   witnesses. When the first party has presented all his/her evidence, that party will rest his/her   case. The other party then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means they then   call witnesses and introduce any exhibits. The first party has the right to cross-examine the      second party’s witnesses.      Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated  3      After the presentation of all the evidence, the attorneys have the opportunity to make   a closing argument to you. At this time, the attorneys will point to certain evidence and law   they consider favorable to their position and argue persuasively to you to decide the case in   their favor. Both sides have the opportunity to make this closing argument. The closing      arguments are not evidence.      Following the closing arguments, I will charge you on the law applicable to this case.   I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and reach your verdict as to the   issue(s) of (equitable division) (alimony). (You will decide child support in a second phase      of the trial.)      Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the   evidence. Keep an open mind until all of the evidence has been presented to you. I instruct   that it is improper for you to discuss this case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the   case with you or in your presence or hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in   the jury room or elsewhere before actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence   of all 12 of you. (After you have returned your verdict on the issue(s) of (equitable division   of property) (alimony), I will charge you further on the law pertaining to child support.)   Have no contact with the attorneys, parties, or witnesses to this case. Do not go on or about      any areas described by the witnesses to this case.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#101.02'>101.02</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.40'>181.40</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#101.30'>101.30</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.01'>191.01</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#181.20'>181.20</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 00.090' href=' 00.090'> 00.090</a></h4><p> Note Taking by Jurors     <h4><a name=' 00.110' href=' 00.110'> 00.110</a></h4><p> Juror Use of Electronic Technology      END OF PRELIMINARY CHARGE     <h4><a name=' 22.005' href=' 22.005'> 22.005</a></h4><p> Divorce; Introduction      You have been considering the case of (enter name of plaintiff) as Plaintiff v.

(The divorce               Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony      is agreed to by the parties and will be granted by the court upon the conclusion of the trial.)   You will (also) be deciding issues incidental to divorce. Each party is seeking an equitable   division of property (and Plaintiff/Defendant is/are seeking alimony). Each party has the   burden of proof as to what he/she seeks. The party who has the burden of proof must prove      his/her case by what is known as a preponderance of the evidence.

The plaintiff has claimed in the pleadings that he/she is entitled to a divorce on the   ground that the marriage is irretrievably broken, and this allegation has been denied by the   defendant.     With regard to this issue, a marriage is irretrievably broken if either or both parties   are unable or refuse to cohabit, and there are no prospects for a reconciliation between the      parties. It is not necessary to show that either party is at fault in any way. The only question      Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated  7      to be determined is whether or not there are prospects for reconciliation.

McCoy, 281 Ga. 604 (2007)      The fact that one party has hope for reconciliation is not sufficient evidence to   sustain a finding that there are genuine prospects for reconciliation. If you find from the   evidence that there are no genuine prospects for reconciliation and that the marriage is   irretrievably broken, then you would be authorized to grant a divorce to the parties. If you   find that there are prospects for reconciliation and that the marriage is not irretrievably   broken, then you would not be authorized to return a verdict granting a divorce.      McCoy v.

Nonmarital property   can be converted to marital property by an action of the property owner spouse. Whether   nonmarital property is converted is a question of fact for you to decide.

Property that is acquired during the marriage from funds obtained from the sale,   exchange, or use of separate property shall remain the separate property of the person who   contributed the funds. This separate property remains the separate property of the individual   who acquired it, “the property owning spouse.” This separate property may be subject to   equitable division only if you find that it has appreciated (that is, increased in value) due to   marital efforts or has been converted to marital property by an action of the owning spouse.

Marital property is property that is acquired as a direct result of the labor and   investments of the husband and/or the wife during the course of the marriage or separate   property that has been converted to marital property by an action of the property owning   spouse. To determine if property purchased or otherwise acquired during the marriage is   marital property and therefore subject to being divided between the spouses or if it is the   separate property of either the husband or the wife and is not subject to division of property,   you must determine what was the source of the funds to purchase or acquire the property   and/or if the property was separate but due to the action of the property owning spouse, it is   converted to marital property.

(After you have determined what property is   nonmarital property and what property is marital property) In order to make an equitable   division of marital property, you should consider the duration of the marriage; any prior      marriage of either party; the age, health, occupation, and vocational skills and employability      Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated  11      of each party; and the contribution or services of each spouse to the family unit. You should   also consider the amount and sources of income, the estate, debts, liabilities, and needs of   the parties, as well as debts against the property, and the opportunity of each party for future   acquisition of assets by employment or otherwise. Furthermore, the conduct of the parties,   both during the marriage and with reference to the cause of the divorce, is relevant and may   be considered in your determination of an equitable division of marital property.

That is, you may designate a specific property (such as so many shares of stock   in a named company or a certain house or tract of land) to be awarded as   equitable division of property.     2) You may make an equitable division of property in cash. That is, you may   designate a certain sum of money to be awarded as an equitable division of   property, even though that sum of money is not presently in the form of cash.     3) You may make an equitable division of property by awarding specific items of   property and also awarding an amount in cash.     4) You may award percentages of property to spouses or require the parties to sell   property and award the proceeds equitably to the parties.

The   defendant/plaintiff is denying that any resulting trust in the property was ever established      and that the defendant/plaintiff holds title to the property and owns the property by right.      1  Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony      When a party purchases property (in whole or in part) to be placed in a spouse’s   name and there is a delivery and acceptance of the title to the property by the other spouse,   then it is presumed under law that the property is a gift. That presumption may be rebutted if   it is shown that a resulting trust was established. In order to show that a resulting trust was   established, the party claiming that the trust was established must prove, by clear and   convincing evidence, that the property was purchased with the party’s own funds and for the   party’s own benefit, and that the title to such property (in whole or in part) was placed in the   other spouse as a matter of convenience or as an agreement for some other purpose and that   the spouse was holding title to the property merely as trustee for the benefit of the other   spouse.     The presumption of a gift may be rebutted by evidence showing that the party who   made the purchase thereafter exercised ownership over the property in such a manner as was   inconsistent with ownership by the other spouse. In determining this issue, you may consider   evidence of any acts by the spouse holding title whereby that spouse appeared to recognize   that actual ownership was in the other spouse.     If you find by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s own   funds were used to purchase (specify property in dispute) and that the plaintiff/defendant put   the title to all or part of it in the name of the other spouse, and if you further find that, at the   time the plaintiff/defendant did so, the parties recognized and agreed that the spouse holding   the title was doing so as the trustee for the spouse who purchased the property, then you   should find that a resulting trust was created and you should award the title to the property   back to_the defendant/plaintiff. If you find that there was no such recognition and agreement   between the parties, then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of the   other spouse would be considered a gift of (_interest in) the property, and you should not   find a resulting trust but should leave the title as is.

If you find that there was no inceptive fraud on the part of the defendant/plaintiff,   then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of his/her spouse would be   considered a gift (a interest in the property), and you should not find any      inceptive fraud but should leave the property as presently titled.

You can only make an equitable division of property from marital property (as I   have just instructed you), but you can make an alimony award from anything that a person   owns or is awarded to them as their equitable division of property or from future earnings.     The order of these instructions does not mean that you have to make a decision   about equitable division of property before deciding alimony. You may decide equitable   division before deciding alimony, or you may decide alimony before deciding equitable   division of property. You may grant alimony and no equitable division of property, or you   may grant equitable division of property and no alimony, or you may grant both, or you may      grant neither.     <p>Similar sections: <a href='Kansas.html#131.16'>131.16</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#105.03'>105.03</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.01'>191.01</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.21'>191.21</a>; <a href='Kansas.html#191.02'>191.02</a>; </p><h4><a name=' 22.210' href=' 22.210'> 22.210</a></h4><p> Alimony   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, alimony is defined as an award from one party for the   support of the other when the parties are living separate and apart.   O.C.G.A. §19-6-1(a)   You are authorized, but not required, to award alimony to the party claiming a right   to alimony in accordance with that party’s needs and the other party’s ability to pay.

If you decide to make an award of alimony in this case, then you should take into   consideration whether such award is in place of or in addition to an award of equitable   division of property. Additionally, you should bear in mind that assets assigned as   nonmarital property that were not subject to an equitable division may be awarded as   alimony.     Before considering the amount of alimony to be awarded, you must first decide   whether the party (parties) requesting alimony should receive alimony at all.     A spouse is not entitled to alimony as a matter of right solely because the parties   have been married. In determining whether or not to grant alimony, you should consider   evidence, if any, of the factual cause of the separation between parties. You may also   consider evidence, if any, of each party’s conduct toward the other.     0.C.G.A. §19-6-1     Odom v. Odom, 239 Ga. 830 (1977)   Duncan v. Duncan, 262 Ga. 872 (1993)   Weir v.

You may make a lump sum cash award to be paid out of the   estate or assets of the other spouse, and you may require that such a lump sum be   paid in one payment or in installments for a specific period of time. If you find   that the evidence warrants the payment of a lump sum of alimony in installments,   you should bear in mind that this award is considered a property award and will   not terminate upon the death of either party and that such payments will be   payable to or by the estate of a deceased party.     b) Alimony in kind. You may make an award of alimony in kind, which means an   award of designated property, including personal property and real estate, or an   award of a designated interest in real or personal property. Property as used here   includes not only personal property (such as automobiles, household furnishings,   insurance policies) but also real property (such as ownership of an interest in   land). The property may be sold and may be divided in whatever manner you   decide as justified by the evidence. You should bear in mind that this award is   considered a property award and will not terminate upon the death of either party   and that such payments will be payable to or by the estate of a deceased party.     c) Periodic alimony. You may make an award of periodic alimony payments to be   paid in the future; for instance weekly, monthly, or quarterly payments. This   award of periodic alimony payments will terminate upon the death of either party      and is not chargeable to the estate of a deceased party.      Awards of lump sum alimony or a property award payable in installments will not      end upon the spouse’s remarriage or death. However, all obligations for periodic alimony,      Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony Updated  19      however created, where the time for performance has not arrived, end upon the remarriage   of the party to whom the obligations are owed unless otherwise specified.      O.C.G.A. §19-6-5(b)      You may make an award of alimony by using any one of these three methods or by   combining any two of these three methods or by using all three of these methods, if you find      the evidence justifies you in doing so.      (The following should be used if the charge on equitable division of property has   been given.)

The defendant/plaintiff is   denying that any resulting trust in the property was ever established and that the   defendant/plaintiff holds title to the property and owns the property by right.     When a party purchases property (in whole or in part) to be placed in a spouse’s   name, and there is a delivery and acceptance of the title to the property by the other spouse,   then it is presumed under law that the property is a gift. That presumption may be rebutted if   it is shown that a resulting trust was established. In order to show that a resulting trust was   established, the party claiming that the trust was established must prove, by clear and   convincing evidence, that the property was purchased with the party’s own funds and for the   party’s own benefit, and that the title to such property (in whole or in part) was placed in the   other spouse as a matter of convenience or as an agreement for some other purpose and that   the spouse was holding title to the property merely as trustee for the benefit of the other   spouse.     The presumption of a gift may be rebutted by evidence showing that the party who   made the purchase thereafter exercised ownership over the property in such a manner as was      inconsistent with ownership by the other spouse. In determining this issue, you may consider      2  Divorce, Equitable Division of Property, and Alimony      evidence of any acts by the spouse holding title whereby that spouse appeared to recognize   that actual ownership was in the other spouse.     If you find by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s own   funds were used to purchase (specify property in dispute) and that the plaintiff/defendant put   the title to all or part of it in the name of the other spouse, and if you further find that, at the   time the plaintiff/defendant did so, the parties recognized and agreed that the spouse holding   the title was doing so as the trustee for the spouse who purchased the property, then you   should find that a resulting trust was created and you should award the title to the property   back to the defendant/plaintiff. If you find that there was no such recognition and agreement   between the parties, then the plaintiff’ s/defendant’s placement of the title in the name of the   other spouse would be considered a gift of (_interest in) the property, and you should not   find a resulting trust but should leave the title as is.

The testimony is that testimony that you will hear under oath      from the witness(es). Exhibits are documents or photos or other items that have been      2 August 2020 Child Support      admitted into evidence. You will then have those exhibits with you in the jury room for your   use during your deliberations.     I caution you that what the lawyers say during this trial is not evidence.

I have no leanings in this case   whatsoever.

Individuals have an unlimited insurable interest in their own life, health, and bodily   safety and may lawfully take out a policy of insurance on their own life, health, or bodily   safety and have the policy made payable to whomever they please, regardless of whether the   designated beneficiary has an insurable interest.     (Use if applicable.)      A corporation has an insurable interest in      a) the life or physical or mental ability of   1) its directors, officers, or employees, or those of its subsidiaries, or any   other person whose death or disability might cause it financial loss; or   2) ashareholder, pursuant to a contractual arrangement concerning the   reacquisition of shares owned by the shareholder at the time of death or   disability or   b) the life of the principal obligor pursuant to   1) acontract obligating the corporation as part of compensation arrangements or      2) acontract obligating the corporation as guarantor or surety.      (Use if applicable.)     The trustee of a trust established by a corporation providing life, health, disability,   retirement, or similar benefits to employees of the corporation or its affiliates and acting in a   fiduciary capacity with respect to such employees, retired employees, or their dependants or   beneficiaries has an insurable interest in the lives of employees for whom such benefits are   to be provided.     (Use if applicable.)     The insurable interest of a corporation or trustee shall be conveyed automatically to      another corporation or to the trustee of a trust established by such other corporation for its      Insurance 3      sole benefit that has acquired by purchase, merger, or otherwise all or part of the first   corporation’s business.     A corporation or the trustee of a trust may exchange any policy of insurance issued   to itself or to another corporation or the trustee of a trust established by such other   corporation for its sole benefit from which the exchanging corporation has acquired by   purchase, merger, or otherwise all or part of such other corporation’s business for a new   policy of insurance issued to itself without establishing a new insurable interest at the time      of such exchange.   O.C.G.A. §33-24-3(c), (c.1)      (Give in all cases.)     An insurable interest must exist at the time the contract of personal insurance   becomes effective, but this requirement need not exist at the time the loss occurs.     Any personal insurance contract procured (caused to be procured) upon another is   void unless the benefits are payable to the individual insured or that person’s representative   or to a person having, at the time the contract was made, an insurable interest in the   individual insured. When a contract is void, the insurer shall not be liable on the contract but      shall be liable to repay to the person(s) who have paid the premiums, without interest.

Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense,   claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.

O.C.G.A. §11-3-302(d)      If the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the   instrument and the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment,   or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security   interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due   course only to an amount payable under the instrument that at the time of enforcement of the      instrument does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.   O.C.G.A. §11-3-302(e)      To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a      reasonable opportunity to act on it.

Joint tenancy, tenancy in   common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership   alone does not establish a partnership but are only factors to consider. The sharing of gross   returns alone does not establish a partnership. Sharing of profits of the business, however, is   prima facie evidence of the existence of a partnership provided that the share was not for a      payment of the following:      a) debt;     b) wages, salary, or other compensation;   c) rent;     d) annuity;     e) interest or payment on a loan;      f) consideration for a sale.      Except as provided otherwise by law (O.C.G.A.§14-8-16), persons who are not      partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.   O.C.G.A. §14-8-7      A partnership is a contractual relationship and may result from an express agreement   that the relationship shall exist or by implication from certain agreements that the parties   have made. If the parties, by written or oral contract, expressly agree to become partners, a   partnership is created. If they enter into an agreement whereby there is a joint ownership,      use, or enjoyment of the profits of undivided property, real or personal, a partnership arises      by implication. If two or more persons put into an enterprise property, money, or other   things of value other than mere personal services upon agreement that they shall each have   an interest in the profits and that the earnings on the investment shall determine the extent of   all profits, if any, to be received, it is a partnership, although no mention may be made as to      losses.

In order to be a   proximate cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using   ordinary care would have foreseen that the event, or some similar event, might reasonably   result therefrom.

This rule is known as the Last Clear Chance Doctrine. The Last Clear Chance   Doctrine only applies when it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the   plaintiff(s) placed himself/herself/themselves in danger because of his/her/their own   negligence, the defendant actually knew of the plaintiff s (plaintiffs) danger, and the   defendant had opportunity to take action to avoid the injury to the plaintiff(s) by the use of   ordinary care under the conditions and circumstances that existed at that time but failed to   do so. If you find such to be proved, then the failure of the defendant to use ordinary care   under such circumstances to avoid the injury to the plaintiff(s) would be considered the      proximate cause of the plaintiff s (plaintiffs’) injuries.

In proving vicious or dangerous character or propensity, it shall be sufficient to show   that the animal was required to be at heel or on a leash by an ordinance of a city, county, or   consolidated government, and the said animal was at the time of the occurrence not at heel   or on a leash.

The owner/occupier owes persons invited to enter   the premises a duty of ordinary care to have the premises in a reasonably safe condition and   not expose the invitees to unreasonable risk (or to lead them into a dangerous trap). The   owner/occupier is not required to warrant the safety of all persons from all things, but to   exercise the diligence toward making the premises safe that a good business person is   accustomed to use in such matters. The true ground of liability is the owner/occupier's   superior knowledge of the perilous condition and the danger therefrom to persons coming   upon the property. It is when the perilous condition is known to the owner and not known to   the person injured that a recovery is permitted.     In order to prevail, the person injured, the plaintiff, must prove by a preponderance   of the evidence that the owner/occupier, the defendant, had actual or constructive knowledge   of the hazard and that the plaintiff lacked knowledge of the hazard or for some reason,   attributable to the defendant, was prevented from discovering it. To establish constructive   knowledge, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant or the defendant’s employee was   in the immediate area of the hazard and could have easily seen the substance or (2) the   foreign substance remained long enough that ordinary diligence by the defendant or the   defendant’s employees should have discovered it. Constructive knowledge may be inferred   by you, the jury, when there is evidence that the owner lacked a reasonable inspection   procedure, but if the plaintiff produces no evidence that the substance could have been   discovered during a reasonable inspection, then no inference arises that the defendant's      failure to discover the defect was the result of any alleged failure to inspect.

Any injury      resulting from a want of such care and skill shall be an act for which a recovery may be had.   O.C.G.A. §51-1-27      This standard, when applied to the facts and circumstances of any particular case,   must be of such degree of care and skill as, under similar conditions and like surrounding   circumstances, is ordinarily employed by the profession generally.     If a physician or surgeon in the treatment and care of a patient should use that degree   of care and skill ordinarily employed by the profession generally under similar conditions   and like surrounding circumstances, then the physician or surgeon would not be negligent;   therefore, there could be no finding of malpractice. If, on the other hand, the doctor should   fail to use such degree of care and skill, the doctor would be negligent, and if injury resulted      because of such failure, the doctor would be liable for such injury as a result of malpractice.

The person claiming an injury may overcome this legal presumption by   introducing evidence that the physician (or other medical professionals) did not treat the   patient in an ordinarily skillful manner. Expert testimony is usually required to overcome the   presumption, and the burden is on the one claiming injury to show a lack of due care and      skill by a preponderance of the evidence.   Beach v. Lipham, 276 Ga. 302 (2003)      In order for the plaintiff to show that the defendant’s alleged negligence was the   proximate cause of the plaintiff s injury, the plaintiff must present expert testimony. An   expert’s opinion on the issue of whether the defendant’s alleged negligence caused the   plaintiff s injury cannot be based on speculation or possibility. It must be based on   reasonable medical probability or reasonable medical certainty. If you find that the expert’s   testimony regarding causation is not based on reasonable medical probability or reasonable   medical certainty, then the plaintiff has not proved that the plaintiff’ s injury was proximately   caused by the defendant’s alleged negligence, and you would return a verdict for the      defendant.

The manufacturer of a product that is sold as new property may be liable or   responsible to any person who is injured because of a defect in the product that existed at the   time the manufacturer sold the product. However, a manufacturer of a product is not an   insurer, and the fact that a product may cause an injury does not necessarily make the   manufacturer liable. To recover damages under this rule, a person injured by an allegedly   defective product must establish the following three elements by a preponderance of the      evidence:      1) the product was defective,   2) the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer’s control, and      3) the defect in the product was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.      (Choose appropriate defect[s] the jury will be charged on.)     The types(s) of product defect(s) alleged by the plaintiff is/are a manufacturing   defect, a design defect, and/or a defect because of inadequate warning.

There is another way in which you may determine the life expectancy of the plaintiff.   There has been introduced into evidence a copy of the _ mortality tables. If you   desire to determine from this table the life expectancy of a person, look up that person’s age   in one column, and across from the age column, you will find the life expectancy of a person   of that age. Life expectancy shown on any such table is merely a guide that you may follow      while considering the evidence as a whole.      Savannah, etc., Railway v.

Co. v. Burney, 98 Ga. 1 [1894] is recommended.)     If you use the mortality tables, you should take the average annual loss of future   income of the plaintiff and multiply it by the number of years of the plaintiff s life   expectancy. The result will give you the probable gross loss of future earnings. You should   then reduce the loss to its present cash value by using a rate of interest of 5 percent per      annum as a reduction factor.      Florida, etc., R.R. Co. v.

When you have satisfied yourselves what the average annual future loss of income of   (plaintiff) (deceased) would be, you would then figure the cash value for the person’s life. In   order to aid you in coming to a conclusion on that point, (number of) annuity tables are in   evidence before you. An annuity is a sum a person is entitled to per year during that person’s   whole life. Sometimes there is a sale of that annuity for which the present cash value of it   must be determined. An award of damages for permanent loss of earnings amounts to a   forced sale of lifetime earnings. This table is made to show the present cash value of an   annuity, according to the age of the person entitled to an annuity. Turn to that table that is   before you for the purpose of aiding you in measuring damages for loss of future earnings.   Take the average annual loss of future income of (plaintiff) (deceased) and the age of the   (plaintiff) (deceased). You would then consult the annuity tables and find opposite the age   the present value of an annuity of $1.00 per year for the expected remaining life of a person   of that age discounted at the percentage indicated, depending on which you   select. You would multiply that present value of the $1.00 annuity from the table by the   average annual loss of future earnings, and that would be the present cash value if the   plaintiff (deceased) were recovering an annuity of that sum, or entitled to an annuity of that   sum for and during that person’s remaining life. That would be the sum you are trying to   arrive at.     In using your annuity table, you would be entitled to use a rate of interest of 5      percent.

Burney, 98 Ga. 1 (1894)      An annuity table is based on an average length of life as shown by mortality tables   from which it is figured.     You do not have to use the annuity table introduced to you in any way. Such a table   is just a guide that you may follow or not as you see fit, while considering the evidence as   a whole.

O.C.G.A. §51-4-1      You should consider the gross sum that the deceased would have earned to the end of   life had the deceased not been killed, reduced to its present cash value in determining the   amount of the full value of the life of the deceased. The full value of the life of the deceased   is not limited to the amount of money that could have or would have been earned had the      deceased not been killed.      Pollard v. Boatright, 57 Ga.

It is noted        Tort Damages      that the Court of Appeals had tried unsuccessfully to get the Supreme Court to clarify the   law. Florida, etc., R.R. Co. v. Burney, 98 Ga.1 [1894].     When at least as far as the husband or supposed wage earner of the family was   concerned, the measure of damages was the gross sum that the deceased would have earned   to the end of life, reduced to its present cash value. The later cases definitely hold that this   factor is merely something to be considered, without fixing any ultimate test. In the Bulloch   Co. case, it is pointed out [p. 247] that the Court of Appeals had unsuccessfully sought   clarification of the matter by the Supreme Court. At any rate, certiorari was denied by the   Supreme Court in the Bulloch case, which at least tacitly appears to accept the holding   thereon.     It appears that there is now no fixed standard in the matter, and the charge reflects   this state of the law. It would further seem that this lack of standard leaves the damages, at   least in part, to the “enlightened conscience” of the jury, but so far no decision is found   expressly holding even that much.

State   Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell, 538 US 408; 123 S. Ct. 1513   [2003] arises from another state and has not been interpreted in Georgia as of this writing.   Procedures and evidence addressed are specific to that case; however, in broad language,   the opinion addresses and condemns perceived due process problems that occur in many   Jurisdictions, including Georgia. The trial judge needs to be aware of its [6-3] holding and   the trend that it supports. Much of its language may be dicta, but the case is perceived by   many to be a bellwether case on punitive damages. The extent of the effect is not known.     The guidelines of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell,   are written for postjudgment review, but there is strong language suggesting that   postjudgment review [as has often been relied on in Georgia] may not suffice as a substitute   for jury guidance and may not be adequate to comply with due process. Punishment without   due process [i.e., notice of prohibited conduct and severity of punishment] is the issue, and   therefore some guidance adjusted to the evidence is probably necessary. The extent of   required guidance is not known. Prompted by a very strong trend in U.S. cases, Georgia   case law, especially Hospital Authority of Gwinnett Co. V. Jones, has recognized the   guidelines that follow. Some of these guidelines may conflict with or duplicate those   suggested in State Farm v. Campbell. Adjustments to the charge have been made   accordingly. )     In considering the amount of punitive damages, you may consider the following      factors:      1  Tort Damages      1)      2)      3)      4)      5)      6)      7)      8)      9)      the nature and egregiousness (reprehensibility) of the defendant’s conduct     (See 66.760, Reprehensibility; Amplified)     the extent and duration of the defendant’s wrongdoing and the (possibility)   (likelihood) of its recurrence (The word “possibility” is from the opinion;   substitution of “likelihood” may avoid a burden of proof conflict.)     the intent of the defendant in committing the wrong     the profitability of the defendant’s wrongdoing (Give only if supported by evidence.)   the amount of actual damages awarded     the previous awards of punitive damages against the defendant (for the same or   similar conduct) (Parenthetical qualifier added due to language of State Farm v.

You should consider all the evidence, both aggravating and   mitigating, to decide how much punishment the defendant’s conduct deserves. In assessing      reprehensibility, you may consider whether      a) the harm caused was physical, as opposed to economic;     b) the conduct showed an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety   of others;     c) the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability;     d) the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident;     e) the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit (or mere accident)   (The term “accident” is from the State Farm opinion and may conflict with Georgia      law; consider substituting “or was merely a consequence not specifically intended. ”’)   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v.

In determining such amount, you should consider the   condition of the crop before the application of the chemical; its stage of development; the   method of cultivation and husbandry; the probable yield of the crop had it not been   damaged; its probable value at maturity had it not been damaged; the value of the damaged   crop at maturity; and the cost of producing the crop. Considering all these factors, you   should award to the plaintiff, if you believe plaintiff is entitled to recover, the difference   between the net value of the damaged crop at maturity and the net value it would have had if   it had not been damaged.

Business compulsion or   economic duress involves the taking of undue or unjust advantage of a person’s economic   necessity or distress to coerce him into making a contract and is also recognized as a   contractual defense. However, a duress claim of this nature must be based upon acts or   conducts of the opposite party that are wrongful or unlawful. When the signer is   sophisticated in business matters and has access to and in fact obtains advice of counsel, the   defense of duress is not available to void the contract. One may not void a contract on   grounds of duress merely because he entered into it with reluctance, the contract is very   disadvantageous to him, the bargaining power of the parties was unequal, or there was some   unfairness in the negotiations preceding the agreement. (Add the following if waiver is   properly raised as a defense.) (Moreover, even if acts could otherwise have been construed      as sufficient duress to void a note, reliance upon the defense of duress may be waived.)      Frame v. Booth, Wade & Campbell, 238 Ga.

That is, a will is the legal declaration of a person’s   intention as to the disposition of property or other matters after the person’s death. A will   includes the will and all codicils to the will. “Codicil” means an amendment to or   republication of a will. ““Testator’ means a person who has made a will, especially a person   who dies leaving a will. “Beneficiary” means a person, including a trust, who is designated   in a will to take an interest in real or personal property. “Executor” means any person   nominated in a will who has qualified to administer a testate estate, including a person      nominated as alternative or successor executor.

An incapacity to contract may coexist with the capacity to make a will. An insane   individual generally may not make a will except during a lucid interval. A monomaniac may   make a will if the will is in no way connected with the monomania. In all such cases, it must   appear that the will expresses the wishes of the testator unbiased by the insanity or   monomania with which testator is affected. Neither advancing age nor weakness of intellect      nor eccentricity of habit or thought is inconsistent with the capacity to make a will.

Lyon, 134 Ga. 125 [1910]. The   four cases were used to prepare the following instruction. )     (There are two choices for this charge.)     In a proceeding to probate a will, the propounder of the will to which a caveat   (objection) has been filed has the burden to prima facie prove that the will was executed   with the requisite formalities freely and voluntarily by a testator who was at the time of   sound mind and disposing mind and memory. Because he/she offers the will for probate, the   propounder assumes the nonshifting burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence   that these issues are the necessary elements of propounder’s case. This burden of proof does   not shift to the caveator to prove affirmatively that any of these necessary elements do not   exist. Rather, the caveator is required only to come forward with evidence to rebut the   propounder’s prima facie case on these necessary elements. So, if the propounder makes out   a prima facie case, that would authorize the jury to find in his/her favor, if nothing further   appeared. But if the caveator introduces evidence tending to disprove the prima facie case      made by the propounder, then the jury should consider all the evidence introduced both by      Wills 9      the propounder and the caveator (and all the surrounding circumstances) in finally   determining if the propounder has satisfactorily carried his/her burden of proof.

When property is set apart as   a year’s support for the benefit of the surviving spouse alone, the spouse shall thereafter own   the same in fee, without restriction as to use, encumbrance, or disposition. However, if the   decedent leaves minor children by different spouses, the jury shall specify the portion going   to the children of the former spouse or spouses, which shall be vested in those children.   Moreover, if the decedent leaves minor children and the surviving spouse is the parent of the   minor children, the jury may in its discretion specify separate portions for the minor children   and the surviving spouse, if the jury deems the award of separate portions to be in the best   interests of the parties, and the portions shall vest separately in the surviving spouse and the      children.
