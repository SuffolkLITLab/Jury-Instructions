    <h1>Alabama Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to run a similarities between jury instructions. The "base" jury instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive.
    The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. 
    Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. 
    Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared.</p>

(He/she) says (describe the unsafe condition   and how plaintiff says (he/she) was harmed).      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove to your reasonable satisfaction from the evidence   all of the following:      1. That the (street/sidewalk/alley/public way/public   building) was not reasonably safe for the public’s travel or   use;      2. That (name of defendant) knew about the unsafe   condition, or the unsafe condition had existed for such an   unreasonable length of time, or under such circumstances,   that if (name of defendant) had used reasonable care it would   have known about the unsafe condition;      3. That (name of defendant) failed to use reasonable   care to fix the unsafe condition;      4. That (name of plaintiff) was harmed; and,      5. That (name of defendant)’s failure to use reasonable   care to fix the unsafe condition was a cause of (name of   plaintiff)’s harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proved all these things you will   find for (him/her), and then you must determine what   amount of money will fairly and reasonably compensate   (him/her) for the harm. If (name of plaintiff) did not prove   all these things, you must find for (name of defendant).      Approved March 7, 2014      MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff is harmed by a defect   in a Street, etc., maintained by a municipality.      A defect is anything that may reasonably be expected to   interfere with the safe use of the right of way. Johnson v. City of   Opelika, 260 Ala. 551, 554, 71 So. 2d 793, 795 (1954).      References      Ala. Code § 11-47-190 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). This sec-   tion does not impose a duty on a municipality to inspect nor do   municipalities have an affirmative duty to seek out and rectify   defective conditions. The municipality does have the duty to rectify   defective conditions when it has actual notice of the condition or   when the defective condition has remained for such a length of   time that the law will infer that the defect should have been   discovered and fixed.      Slade v. City of Montgomery, 577 So. 2d 887 (Ala. 1991).      City of Tallassee v. Harris, 431 So. 2d 1177 (Ala. 1983). The   jury determined whether an alley was a public way. The city’s   duty was to keep the alley reasonably safe for travel; not to keep   the alley reasonably safe.      City of Gadsden v. Ryan, 284 Ala. 484, 226 So. 2d 87 (1969).      Jacks v. City of Birmingham, 268 Ala. 138, 105 So. 2d 121   (1958).      Johnson v. City of Opelika, 260 Ala. 551, 554, 71 So. 2d 793,   795 (1954). A defect is anything that may reasonably be expected   to interfere with the safe use of the right of way.      Brooks v. City of Birmingham, 239 Ala. 172, 194 So. 525 (1940).

This is called contributory negligence   and is a defense to (name of plaintiff)’s claim that (name of   defendant) was negligent. Contributory negligence is the   failure to use reasonable care to prevent harm to oneself.      (Name of defendant) says (name of plaintiff)’s conduct   was negligent because (state why).      To prove this defense, (name of defendant) must prove   to your reasonable satisfaction from the evidence all of the   following:      1. That (name of plaintiff) was negligent; and,      2. That (name of plaintiff)’s negligence was a cause of   (his/her) harm.      If (name of defendant) proved these things (name of   plaintiff) cannot recover and you must find for (name of   defendant).      (Forgetfulness—Distraction)      If (name of plaintiff) (knew about) (should have seen)   the defect, you must determine if (he/she) had a satisfactory   excuse for not avoiding its danger. The reason must be   something more than mere inattention or just thinking about   something else. It must be some outside event (or a distrac-   tion) that happened at about the same time (name of   plaintiff) (describe the event, e.g., tripped, etc.). If you find   the excuse reasonable, then you must find the plaintiff was   not contributory negligent.      Approved March 7, 2014            Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the defendant pleads contributory   negligence.      Use the instruction about forgetfulness or distraction only   when the plaintiff produces evidence of either.      There is a rebuttable presumption the plaintiff was contribu-   tory negligent when the plaintiff knows about a defect and forgets   it, or the plaintiff, if he or she was using reasonable care, should   have seen the defect but was distracted.

Approved March 7, 2014      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when a municipality negligently con-   structed or maintained a drainage system and asa result the   plaintiffs property flooded.      A municipality does not have a duty to construct or maintain   a drainage system, but when it does a duty of care exists. Royal   Automotive, Inc. v. City of Vestavia Hills, 995 So. 2d 154 (Ala.   2008). A municipality can voluntarily assume the duty to maintain   a drainage system. Kennedy v. City of Montgomery, 423 So. 2d 187   (Ala. 1982).      The cases about negligent construction of drainage systems      8      MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS      are not limited to flooding that results in property damage. See, e.   g., Craig v. City of Mobile, 658 So. 2d 438 (Ala. 1995) Guvenile   injured by object city dumped into drainage canal); Lee v.

That (name of plaintiff) was harmed; and      3. That (name of defendant)’s negligence was a   cause of (name of plaintiff)’s harm.      Notes on Use      Use this introductory instruction to explain the necessary ele-   ments that the plaintiff must prove before the jury can find the   defendant liable for the plaintiffs harm.      The trial judge determines whether the defendant owes a duty   to the plaintiff. Therefore, instructions explaining duty should not   be given.      “[T]he existence of a duty is a strictly legal question to be   determined by the court.” Taylor v. Smith, 892 So. 2d 887, 891-92   (Ala. 2004).

A person’s conduct is negligent when (he/she) either does   something that a reasonably prudent person would not do in   a similar situation, or (he/she) fails to do something that a   reasonably prudent person would have done in a similar   situation.

Because   of this, the general rules of law that apply to adults apply to   normal children who are at least 14 years old.      If you are reasonably satisfied that at the time of the   event defendant (name of defendant) was a normal child 14   years old or older, you will decide whether (his/her) conduct   was negligent.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction only when a child is 14 years old and over   and less than 19 years old, and the capacity of the child is a legiti-   mate issue.      Do not use this instruction in cases involving children and   dangerous instrumentalities or artificial conditions upon land.

This is a Latin phrase that means the thing speaks for itself.   Under the doctrine, (name of plaintiff) may prove negligence   by circumstantial evidence.      (Name of plaintiff) must prove to your reasonable satis-   faction from the evidence:      1. That the (thing/place/condition/system) that caused   (name of plaintiff)’s harm was under (name of defendant)’s   full control;      2. That the circumstances of the event are the kind, that   according to common knowledge and experience, (name of   plaintiff) could not have been harmed if (name of defendant)   had used reasonable care; and,      3. That neither (name of plaintiff)’s conduct nor the   conduct of third persons caused (name of plaintiff)’s harm.   But, the evidence need not conclusively exclude all other   possible explanations why (name of plaintiff) was harmed.      If (name of plaintiff) proved these things, you may infer,   but you do not have to infer, that (name of defendant) was   negligent.      Approved August 10, 2018      Notes on Use      Use this instruction in common tort cases when the defendant   owes a duty to the plaintiff. If the case involves a common carrier,   the user should review the case law and determine whether it   requires the carrier to disprove negligence.      The instruction assumes the plaintiff claims only one negligent   actor.      The trial judge must first determine whether the doctrine of      35            res ipsa loquitur applies. The doctrine permits the jury to infer the   defendant did not use reasonable care, but the plaintiff must prove   all the elements of negligence, i.e., causation and harm.      The doctrine does not apply to slip and fall cases, and it can-   not be used to establish wanton conduct.

Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims the defendant’s   conduct is willful.      This instruction can be used in conjunction with,   and wanton conduct can be inserted in the appropriate space.   Because the plaintiff does not have to prove willful conduct by   direct evidence, the user may also instruct with and   15.01 (Inference of Fact and Inferences).      Whether the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff is   always a matter of law to be decided by the trial judge. This   instruction assumes that the defendant owed a legal duty to the   plaintiff.      References      Hooper v. Columbus Regional Healthcare System, Inc., 956   So. 2d 1135 (Ala. 2006).

This is true even though the (principal/master/employer)   did not take an active part in the wanton conduct.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that a defendant   is liable for the agent’s, et cetera, wanton conduct. However, if the   plaintiff is claiming punitive damages, the jury must be instructed   in accordance with Ala. Code § 6-11-27 (1975) (West’s Alabama   Code). Cf. Cain v. Mortgage Realty Co., Inc., 723 So. 2d 631, 633   (Ala. 1998) (trial court erroneously instructed jury on § 6-11-27 in   a wrongful death case).      References   Foster v.

Code § 6-5-27 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) is that where   proof that an agent committed an intentional, wanton, or negligent   act while in the line and scope of his employment, liability for such   act would be imputed to the principal, regardless of the actual   participation of the principal in the intentional, wanton or   negligent act or omission under the doctrine of respondeat   superior.”      43            Cain v. Mortgage Realty Co., Inc., 723 So. 2d 631 (Ala. 1998).   In this wrongful death case the trial court instructed the jury on   Ala. Code § 6-11-27 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). The court re-   versed because the instruction is erroneous because the only dam-   ages awarded in a death case are punitive. The court said: “[I]n   the usual case, a jury may award compensatory damages against a   principal based on general common-law principles of agency, but   may award punitive damages only if it finds one of the specific   criteria listed in § 6-11-27(a).” 723 So. 2d at 633.

To re-   cover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff) must prove   to your reasonable satisfaction all of the following:      1. That (name of defendant) intended to cause (name   of plaintiff) emotional distress, or (he/she/it) knew or should   have known that (his/her/its) conduct was likely to cause   (name of plaintiff) emotional distress;      2. That (name of defendant)’s conduct was extreme   and outrageous. (Name of defendant)’s conduct is extreme   when it is so outrageous in character and so extreme in   degree that it goes beyond all bounds of decency, and it is   regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized   society;      3. That (name of defendant)’s intentional or reckless   conduct caused (name of plaintiff) emotional distress; and      4, That (name of plaintiff)’s emotional distress was so   severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure   it.      Notes on Use   Use this instruction to instruct on the tort of outrage.      The tort of outrage, also labeled intentional infliction of emo-   tional distress, was first recognized in Alabama in American Road   Service Co. v. Inmon, 394 So. 2d 361, 118 L.R.R.M.

This is called contributory negligence   and is a defense to (name of plaintiff)’s claim that (name of   defendant) was negligent. Contributory negligence is the   failure to use reasonable care to prevent harm to oneself.      To prove this defense, (name of defendant) must prove   to your reasonable satisfaction all of the following:      1. That (name of plaintiff) was negligent; and      2. That (name of plaintiff)’s negligence was a cause of   (his/her) harm.      If (name of plaintiff)’s conduct was contributory negli-   gence, (he/she) cannot recover on (his/her) claim that (name   of defendant) was negligent.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the defendant has pleaded contribu-   tory negligence. The instruction defines contributory negligence,   and explains who has the burden of proof and the effect of proving   the defense. It combines former, 30.01, and 30.02 into   one instruction.      References      Sessions v. Nonnenmann, 842 So. 2d 649 (Ala. 2002). The proof   required for establishing contributory negligence as a matter of   law should be distinguished from an instruction given to a jury   when determining whether a plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable   care. A jury determining whether a plaintiff has been guilty of con-   tributory negligence must only decide whether the plaintiff failed   to exercise reasonable care.      See H.R.H. Metals, Inc. v. Miller ex rel. Miller, 833 So. 2d 18   (Ala. 2002).      48      CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE      Hannah v. Gregg, Bland & Berry, Inc., 840 So. 2d 839 (Ala.   2002).      Cackowski v.

Contribu-   tory negligence is an affirmative defense. However, it is error to   instruct the jury that the “slightest degree” of contributory   negligence will bar the plaintiffs claim for negligence.     Cooper v.

To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove to your reasonable satisfaction all of the   following:      1. That (name of plaintiff) was an invitee (in/on) (de-   scribe the premises);      (He/she) was an invitee if (he/she) was in (describe the   premises) at the expressed or implied invitation of (name   of defendant), and (name of plaintiff) was there for a   business purpose or for (name of defendant)’s material   benefit.      2. That the (describe the premises or area where the   harm occurred) was not in a reasonably safe condi-   tion because (describe the condition);      3. That (name of defendant) (knew), or should have   known about the condition, or (name of defendant)   was at fault in not discovering the condition;      4, (Name of plaintiff) was harmed; and,      5. That (name of defendant)’s (negligent/wanton) fail-   ure to keep the (describe the premises) in a reason-   ably safe condition caused (name of plaintiff)’s harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proves these things you will find   for (him/her) and determine what amount of money will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her) for the harm. If   (name of plaintiff) does not prove all of these things, you will      61            find for (name of defendant).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction as the base instruction in a simple slip or   trip and fall case. The definition of “invitee” is stated in APJI 31.   01; however, in keeping with plain language principles that a word   is defined immediately after it is used, the definition is included in   this instruction.      Duty      The general duty of the store keeper to an invitee is to use   reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe   condition. Vargo v. Warehouse Groceries Management, Inc., 529   So. 2d 986 (Ala. 1988). Whether a duty is owed is always a ques-   tion for the trial court; therefore, it is not specifically defined in   this or a separate instruction. Rather, it is set out in paragraph   numbered 5 of the instruction. The Committee suggests that the   jury not be told about duty as such, and that it be interwoven in   the instruction.      If the trial judge believes the jury should be instructed about   duty in greater detail, the Committee recommends the judge   instruct the jury, as follows:      (Name of defendant) must keep (describe the premises) in a   reasonably safe condition for invitees. (Name of defendant) must   warn invitees about any dangers that (name of defendant) knows   about or should know about and an invitee does not know.      In Daniels v. Wiley, Ms. 1190208, 2020 WL 3478593 (Ala.   June 26, 2020), the Court held if a dangerous condition is open   and obvious, the invitor does not have a duty to warn the invitee   about the condition. The Court overruled several named cases,   and, potentially, other cases “citing, quoting, and/or applying the   Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A [that] may hold otherwise,   ... . Daniels at *9.      Scope of the invitation      A plaintiffs legal status changes when he or she exceeds the   scope of the invitation. The scope of an invitation relates to area   and it can relate to time. Generally, the status changes from   invitee to licensee, and the corresponding duty of care changes.      62      PREMISES LIABILITY      Winn-Dixie, Montgomery, Inc. v. Cox, 284 Ala. 362, 224 So. 2d 908   (1969). See APJI 31A.01.      Rain water and snow cases      When the plaintiff claims that he or she slipped on rainwater   or snow on the floor and does not claim that the floor was   defectively designed or built, the trial judge must supplement this   instruction to fully explain the storekeeper’s responsibility. This is   because “[a] fall caused by snow or rain is distinguishable from a   fall resulting from some other object as in the usual slip and fall   case.” Gulas v.

(Name of defendant) says that the condition, if it   existed, was open and obvious or that if (name of plaintiff)   had used reasonable care, (he/she) would have recognized   the danger.      (Name of defendant) must keep (describe the premises)   in a reasonably safe condition for use by (name of plaintiff),   but if a danger exists and (name of defendant) knows about   or should know about the danger, (he/she/it) must warn   (name of plaintiff) about it.      However, (name of defendant) does not have to warn   (name of plaintiff) about a danger that is open and obvious,   or a danger that (name of plaintiff) would have recognized if   (he/she) had used reasonable care.      This is called the open and obvious defense, and it is a   defense to (name of plaintiff)’s claim that (name of defendant)   failed to warn about the danger.      To prove this defense, (name of defendant) must prove   to your reasonable satisfaction:      1. That (name of plaintiff) was aware of the condition   and appreciated the danger it involved, or,      2. (Name of plaintiff) would have recognized the danger   presented by the condition if (he/she) had used rea-   sonable care.      If (name of defendant) proves this defense, (name of   plaintiff) cannot recover on (his/her) claim that (he/she) was   harmed by a dangerous condition.      Revised Sept. 11, 2020      69            Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the jury must determine whether   the owner or possessor of property must warn an invitee about a   dangerous condition. Daniels v. Wiley, Ms. 1190208, 2020 WL   3478593 (Ala. June 26, 2020). If the jury determines the defendant   owed a duty to an invitee, only then can the jury consider any   other affirmative defenses the defendant pleaded.

If a dangerous condition is open and obvious, the invitor   does not have a duty to warn the invitee about the condition.

Do not use this instruction when the   defendant’s active negligent or wanton conduct causes plaintiff's   harm.      When a licensee is harmed by a condition on the land, the law   of premises liability applies; however, when the licensee is harmed   because of the defendant’s active negligence, traditional negligence   standards apply. Lilya v. Greater Gulf State Fair, Inc., 855 So. 2d   1049 (Ala. 2003); Baldwin v. Gartman, 604 So. 2d 347 (Ala. 1992);   Orr By and Through Orr v. Turney, 535 So. 2d 150 (Ala. 1988).

Definitions and duty of care      The cases generally state that the duty of the owner or oc-   cupant of premises to a licensee is not to willfully or wantonly   injure him, nor negligently injure him after discovering he is in a   position of peril.      The instruction combines the definitions of a licensee and   social guest and the duty of care owed a licensee into one elements      instruction.

Before you can find that (name of plaintiff) com-   mitted the crime of (name the crime) you must find all of the   following elements (instruct on as many of the elements of   the crime as are necessary).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when there is evidence that the plaintiff   is a trespasser and he or she is harmed while committing a crime   involving moral turpitude.      The law on this point is not restricted to adults. Oden v. Pepsi   Cola Bottling Co. of Decatur, Inc., 621 So. 2d 953, Prod. Liab. Rep.   (CCH) P 13620 (Ala. 1993). The Committee notes that the criminal   law of this state assumes that children of a certain age cannot   form the requisite criminal intent, and any instruction may also   require inclusion of the factors stated in Lyle v. Bouler, 547 So. 2d   506 (Ala. 1989).      Oden’s applicability is restricted to cases when the trespasser   knowingly and intentionally participates in a crime involving moral   turpitude. Therefore, the judge must instruct on the elements nec-   essary to establish the offense; however, the court may not have to   instruct on all elements. For instance, the court may not have to   instruct on the value element of theft of property. However, the of-   fense must be one that requires proof of a knowing and intentional   act. Moreover, it may be necessary to instruct on “complicity” in   the appropriate case.      The user should review 2012 Ala. Acts 502, codified at Ala.   79            Code § 6-5-346 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code), effective August 1,     2012. The Act addresses land owners’ and their agent’s civil li-     ability or immunity from civil suit when a person who comes onto     real property is harmed, and that person came onto the real prop-     erty for the purpose of committing criminal conduct. The Act is not     restricted to adults or crimes involving moral turpitude.   References      Oden v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Decatur, Inc., 621 So. 2d   953, Prod. Liab. Rep.

Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that a child was   harmed because of an artificial condition on the defendant’s   premises or land, and the child was either a licensee or trespasser.      This instruction does not apply when the child was an invitee.      In the appropriate case use in conjunction with   this instruction.      2012 Ala.

CODE §8§ 35-15-20 TO 28 (1975)   (WEST’S ALABAMA CODE) [PL]      Alabama law protects a landowner who allows the pub-   lic to use (his/her/its) land for recreation. The protection is   given when the landowner does not intend to make a profit   from the public’s use. This is called opening the land to the   public for a non-commercial purpose. In this situation the   law does not hold the landowner responsible for the harm   that happens to people on (his/her/its) land.      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says the land was open to   the public for a commercial purpose. (Name of defendant)   says (he/she/it) is not responsible for (name of plaintiff)’s   harm because the land was open to the public for a non-   commercial purpose. You must decide if the land was open   to the public for a commercial or non-commercial purpose.      (Name of plaintiff) must prove that when (name of   defendant) opened the land to the public (his/her/its) intent   or purpose was to make a profit. It does not matter whether   (name of defendant) made a profit. The fact, if it is a fact,   that (name of defendant) may have charged a fee for the   public to use the land does not alone mean (he/she/it)   intended to make a profit. A landowner may charge some fee   that is used to maintain and keep up the land when the land   is mainly used for things other than public recreational   purposes so long as (he/she/it) does not charge the fee to   make a profit. You must consider all the evidence to decide   whether (name of defendant) intended to make a profit.      If you are not reasonably satisfied by the evidence that   (name of defendant) intended to make a profit by opening   the land to the public, you must find for (name of defendant).      If you are reasonably satisfied by the evidence that   (name of defendant) intended to make a profit this law does      86      PREMISES LIABILITY      not protect (him/her/it). You then must consider the other   instructions I give you about the responsibility of landown-   ers for harm caused to people on their land.      Notes on Use      The Committee did not attempt to publish instructions that   cover all of the situations presented in a case that involves the   Recreational Use Statute, and it strongly recommends that the   user study the statute and case authority to determine its ap-   plicability to a specific case.      Use this instruction when defendant pleads the statutory   protection stated in Ala. Code §§ 35-15-20 to 35-15-28 (1975)   (West’s Alabama Code) (sometimes referred to as Article 2 of the   Alabama Recreational Use Statute), and plaintiff claims the   defendant is not entitled to the protection because defendant did   not make the land available for non-commercial use. The instruc-   tion assumes the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the use is   non-commercial, but the defendant may have the burden of going   forward on this issue under § 35-15-28.      In addition to the, the jury must be given appropri-   ate instructions on the liability of owners of land because the jury   may find the statutory protection does not apply.      If plaintiff claims the facts are within the exception for know-   ingly failing to guard or warn of a condition which involves an un-   reasonable risk of serious bodily harm or death which is known to   the landowner and not apparent to the public entering the land,   see which instructs on the exception stated in § 35-15-   24.      If there is an issue about whether the use of the land was for   “recreational” purposes, see the definition of “recreational use or   recreational purpose” in Ala. Code § 35-15-21(3) (1975) (West’s Al-   abama Code). Also, see the same section for other applicable   definitions.      References   Ex parte Town of Dauphin Island, 274 So. 3d 237 (Ala. 2018).

Acts 666 (Article 1),   and codified as Ala. Code §§ 35-15-1 to 5 (1975) (West’s Alabama   Code); and 1981 Ala. Acts 825 (Article 2) codified as Ala.

Ex parte City of Geneva explains the   differences, as follows:      Sections 35-15-1 through -5 of the recreational use   statutes, appearing in Article 1 of Chapter 15, define and limit   the duties of an owner of recreational land in relation to a   person using the land for recreational purposes. Under these   sections, “[a]n owner, whether public or private, owes no duty   to users of the premises except for injury caused by a willful or   malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condi-   tion, use, structure, or activity.” Poole v. City of Gadsden, 541   So. 2d 510 (Ala. 1989); Ala. Code § 35-15-3 (1975) (West’s Ala-   bama Code).      Unlike Article 1, Article 2, consisting of §§ 35-15-20   through 28, applies specifically to owners of noncommercial   public recreational land, such as the City here. These sections   ‘provide such landowners with even greater protections than   §§ 35-15-1 through -5.’ Poole, at 513. See also Grice v. City of   Dothan, 670 F.

CODE § 35-15-24   (1975) (WEST’S ALABAMA CODE)   [PL]      Alabama law protects a landowner who allows the pub-   lic to use (his/her/its) land and water for recreation. The   protection is given when the landowner does not intend to   make a profit from the public’s use. This is called opening   the land and water to the public for a non-commercial   purpose. In this situation the law usually does not hold the   landowner responsible for the harm that happens to people   on (his/her/its) land (water). There is an exception to this   rule, and the plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says this case   involves that exception.      (Name of plaintiff) says (he/she) was on (name of   defendant)’s property and was harmed when (describe how   the harm occurred). (He/she) says further that (name of   defendant) was required to warn (him/her) about this, that   (name of defendant) did not warn (him/her), and (name of   defendant)’s failure to warn (him/her) caused (his/her) harm.      (Name of defendant) says (he/she/it) is not responsible   for the harm, if any, and (he/she/it) did not have to warn   (name of plaintiff) about the (condition, use, structure, or   activity).      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove to your reasonable satisfaction all of the   following:      1.

That (name of defendant) had actual knowledge that     91            (describe the condition, use, structure, or activity that   plaintiff says led to the harm) existed and involved an un-   reasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to persons   using the property;      3. That (name of defendant) had actual knowledge that   (describe the condition, use, structure, or activity that   plaintiff says led to the harm) was not apparent to persons   using the property;      The words “not apparent” mean that a person could not   avoid (describe the condition, use, structure, or activity) by   using reasonable care.      4. With this knowledge and in disregard of the possible   consequences, (name of defendant) chose not to guard or   warn persons such as (name of plaintiff); and,      5. (Name of defendant)’s conduct caused (name of   plaintiff) harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proves these things you will find   for (him/her) and determine what amount of money will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her) for the harm.

(Name of defendant) ((denies (he/she/it) trespassed)   (caused anyone to trespass)) (says (he/she/it) had (permission/   authority, describe) to be on (name of plaintiff)’s property).      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove to your reasonable satisfaction all of the   following:      1. (He/she/it) (had title to, owned, possessed, or   adversely possessed) the property;      2. a. (Name of defendant) intentionally entered (name   of plaintiff)’s property without (his/her/its) consent; or,      b. (Name of defendant) caused (his/her/its) (agent/   servant/employee) to enter (name of plaintiff)’s property   without (his/her/its) consent; or,      c. (Name of defendant) intentionally caused some   object or thing to enter (name of plaintiff)’s property without   (his/her/its) consent; or,      d. (Name of defendant) had (name of plaintiff)’s consent   to enter (name of plaintiff)’s property, but, (name of   defendant)’s conduct went beyond the purpose for which (he/   she/it) was permitted to enter; or,      e. (Name of defendant) had (name of plaintiff)’s consent   to enter (name of plaintiff)’s property, but (name of defen-   dant) remained on the property after the invitation or   permission expired; or,      f. (Name of defendant) had (name of plaintiff)’s consent   to enter (name of plaintiff)’s property, and went into an area   that (he/she/it) was not invited or permitted to enter; or,      g. (Name of defendant) was required to remove a      102      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND APJI 31A.00      structure or thing from (name of plaintiff)’s property but   (name of defendant) did not remove it.      The word intentionally means that (name of defendant)   intended to enter or cause someone or thing to enter the   property. It does not mean that (name of defendant) intended   to trespass on (name of plaintiff)’s property.      3. (Name of defendant)’s entry onto the property   (remaining on the property) caused (name of plaintiff) harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proves these things, you will find   for (him/her/it) and determine what amount of money will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her/it) for the harm.   If (name of plaintiff) does not prove these things, you will   find for (name of defendant).      Wanton Conduct      (A defendant’s conduct can be wanton. (Name of defen-   dant)’s conduct is wanton when (he/she/it) knows (he/she/it)   is invading (name of plaintiff)’s rights.)      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the defendant intentionally enters   plaintiffs property. Do not use it when plaintiff claims an invasory   trespass, APJI 31A.02, or when plaintiff claims the statutory   penalty for cutting trees.

Acts 300 adds “Section 6-5-345 to codify case law re-   lating to the duty of care that an owner of real property owes to   certain trespassers on his or her property.” Section 6-5-345 does   not “change, amend, or otherwise affect the provisions of sections   35-15-1 through 35-15 40 Code of Alabama 1975.” 2012 Ala. Acts   300 § 1 (e). Sections 35-15-1 through 35-15-40 encompass the   recreational use statutes and the Landowners Protection Act.

His neighbor cannot weaken or   destroy this right by excavations or other activity on their   land. However, this right only applies to the land in its nat-   ural state; this means land without houses, buildings, or   other artificial structures on it.      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says (his/her/its) land joins   defendant’s (name of defendant) land. (Name of plaintiff)   also says (name of defendant) (describe the defendant’s   conduct that plaintiff says removed the lateral support, e.g.,   blasting, digging a foundation, excavating, etc.) and this   weakened or destroyed the lateral support for (his/her/its)   land and caused it to (describe the physical effect, e.g., crack,   sink, slough off, etc.).      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove all of the following:      1. That (his/her/its) and (name of defendant)’s lands   join;      2. That (name of defendant) (describe the activity   plaintiff says removed the lateral support), and this weak-   ened or destroyed the lateral support for (name of plaintiff)’s   land; and,      3. That the loss of lateral support harmed (name of   plaintiff)’s land.      If (name of plaintiff) proves these things, you will find   for (him/her/it) and determine what amount of money will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her/it) for the harm.   If (name of plaintiff) does not prove these things, you will   find for (name of defendant).      109      APJI 31A.03 ALABAMA PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that the   defendant withdrew lateral support from plaintiffs land that was   in its natural state. Use APJI 31A.04 if the plaintiff claims that   the loss of lateral support harmed land with structures.      If an adjoining land owner withdraws the lateral support from   the neighbor’s land in its natural state and the land is harmed, the   defendant is strictly liable for the harm.      A claim for withdrawing lateral support can be based in   nuisance. Chambers v. Summerville United Methodist Church,   Inc., 675 So. 2d 1315 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996). Therefore, if the claim   is for nuisance, also use APJI 31A.25.      References      Nichols v. Woodward Iron Co., 267 Ala. 401, 103 So. 2d 319   (1958).      H.H. Parker & Bro. v.

His neighbor cannot   weaken or destroy this right by excavations or other activity   on their land. However, this absolute right only applies to   the land in its natural state; this means land without houses,   buildings, or other artificial structures on it because their   weight increases the outward pressure on the neighbor’s   land.      However, there are situations when a person may be   responsible for harm to his neighbor’s land that is not in its   natural state. This situation happens if the person conducts   a lawful activity on his land; negligently performs the activ-   ity and causes harm to his neighbor’s land and the structures   on it; and the added weight of the structures on the land did   not contribute to the harm.      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says (his/her/its) land joins   defendant (name of defendant)’s land. (Name of plaintiff)   also says (name of defendant) (describe the negligent conduct   plaintiff says removed the lateral support) and this weakened   or destroyed the lateral support for (his/her/its) land, and   caused (describe the physical harm to the (land) (describe   the structure)).      To recover damages for this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove all of the following:      1. That (his/her/its) and (name of defendant)’s lands   join;      2. That (name of defendant) (describe the activity   plaintiff says removed the lateral support) and this weakened   or destroyed the lateral support for (name of plaintiff)’s land;      112      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND AP JI 31A.04      3. That the (describe the structure) on (name of   plaintiff)’s land did not increase the lateral pressure on   (name of defendant)’s land; and,      4. That (name of defendant) negligently (describe the   lawful activity) and (his/her/its) negligent conduct caused   harm to (name of plaintiff)’s (land) (structures).      If (name of plaintiff) proves these things, you will find   for (him/her/it) and determine what amount of money will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her/it) for the harm.   If (name of plaintiff) does not prove these things, you will   find for (name of defendant).

(Name of plaintiff) also says that it   caused harm to (his/her/its) (land), (personal property), (de-   scribe the harm).      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove all of the following:      1. That (name of defendant)’s use of explosives was   abnormally dangerous; and,      2. That the explosion/s/ caused harm to ((name of   plaintiff) or (name of plaintiff)’s land or personal   property).      The fact, if it is a fact, that (name of defendant) used care to   prevent the harm is not a defense to this claim.      To decide if (name of defendant)’s use of explosives was   abnormally dangerous, you must consider all the evidence   and the following factors:      1. Whether there was a high degree of risk that some   (person) (land) (personal property) would be harmed.      2. Whether it was likely that any harm that resulted   would be great.      3. Whether it is impossible to eliminate the risk of   harm by the use of reasonable care.      4. The extent to which the use of explosives is not cus-   tomarily carried on by many people in the community.      5. Whether the use of explosives was appropriate   where it was done.      114      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND AP.JI 31A.05      6. The extent to which the use of explosives has value   to the community that is outweighed by its dangerous   character.      You need not find that all these factors are present to be   reasonably satisfied that the activity was abnormally danger-   ous, but you must be reasonably satisfied from all the evi-   dence that the activity was abnormally dangerous.      If (name of plaintiff) proves that (name of defendant)’s   use of the explosives was abnormally dangerous and caused   harm to (him/her) (the land) (the personal property), you will   find for (name of plaintiff) and determine what amount of   money will fairly and reasonably compensate (name of   plaintiff) for the harm. If (name of plaintiff) does not prove   these things, you will find for (name of defendant).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that the   defendant’s blasting was an abnormally dangerous activity.      The abnormally dangerous doctrine is not restricted to blast-   ing cases. See, e.g., Avery v. Geneva County, 567 So. 2d 282 (Ala.   1990).

The measure of damage is the difference between the   reasonable market value of the property immediately before   the harm and the reasonable market value immediately af-   ter the harm.      You must decide if (name of defendant)’s trespass   harmed (name of plaintiff)’s property. If it did, you must   then determine the difference, if any, between the reason-   able market values of the property immediately before and   immediately after the harm.      Notes on Use      This instruction states the general rule about the measure of   direct compensatory damage to real property and is based on the   holding in Poffenbarger v. Merit Energy Co., 972 So. 2d 792 (Ala.   2007). The Poffenbargers sued Merit Energy Company for trespass,   nuisance, negligence and wanton conduct when Merit’s oil pipeline   leaked oil and it entered the Poffenbarger’s land. The court held   that the general rule about the measure of direct compensatory   damage to real property is “the diminution in the value of that   property even when the cost to remediate the property exceeds the   diminution in value. . .” Id at 801. The rule is flexible, and Pof-   fenbarger discusses the rule and its exceptions. See the references   for exceptions to the general rule.      This instruction states the general rule about the measure of   damages; however, “[t]his rule is subservient to the underlying   proposition for measuring damages in trespass cases: The Plaintiff   is ordinarily entitled to an amount which will compensate him for      actual damages sustained.” Borland v.

Permanent harm is harm that cannot be repaired.      The measure of damage is the difference between the   reasonable market value of the property immediately before   the harm and the reasonable market value immediately af-   ter the harm. When you decide the value of the property im-   mediately before the harm, you may consider how (name of   plaintiff) used the property (and you may consider any other   way (name of plaintiff) reasonably could have used the   property).      You must decide if (name of defendant)’s conduct   harmed (name of plaintiff)’s property. If it did, you must   then determine the difference, if any, between the reason-   able market values of the property before and immediately   after the harm.

De      APJI 31A.15 ALABAMA PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS      APJI 314.15 TRESPASS—REAL PROPERTY—   PUNITIVE DAMAGES [PL]      Punitive damages are awarded to a plaintiff to punish a   defendant for (his/her/its) wrongful conduct, and to protect   the public by deterring or discouraging the defendant and   others from trespassing on another’s land in the future.      Before you can award punitive damages (1) you must   have decided to award (name of plaintiff) compensatory or   nominal damages; and (2) (name of plaintiff) must have   proved by clear and convincing evidence that (name of   defendant) consciously or deliberately acted toward (name of   plaintiff) with (oppression) (wantonness) or (malice).      Clear and convincing evidence means evidence that,   when weighed against opposing evidence, produces in your   mind a firm conviction about each element of the claim and   a high probability that your conclusion is correct.      Proof by clear and convincing evidence requires a level   of proof greater than proof to your reasonable satisfaction   from the evidence or the substantial weight of the evidence,   but it is less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.      (Oppression means causing a person to undergo cruel   and unjust hardship in knowing disregard of that person’s   rights.)      (Wantonness is conduct that is carried on with a reckless   or conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.).      (Malice is the intentional doing of a wrongful act without   just cause or excuse, either:      1. With an intent to injure the person or property of another   person or entity, or      2. Under circumstances that the law will imply an evil   intent.)      Whether you award punitive damages is up to you. If      128      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND AP.JI 31A.15      you do, the amount of the award is determined by the   character and degree of (name of defendant)’s wrongful   conduct, and the necessity to prevent the same or similar   wrongful conduct by the defendant and others in the future.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims trespass to   realty and the evidence requires an instruction on punitive   damages.      The bench and bar should note that the opinion in Downs v.   Lyles, 41 So. 3d 86 (Ala. Civ. App. 2009) quoted case language, as   opposed to the statutory definitions (Ala. Code § 6-11-20 (b) (2) &   (3) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code)), when it discussed punitive   damages. The Court stated: “Punitive damages are also available   to a plaintiff in a trespass action, even if only nominal damages   are awarded, ‘if the trespass is attended by rudeness, wantonness,   recklessness or an insulting manner or is accompanied by circum-   stances of fraud and malice, oppression, aggravation, or gross   negligence.’ Rushing, 293 Ala. at 61, 300 So.2d at 98.” Id. at 92.   Ala. Code § 6-11-20 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) governs “any   civil action”; therefore, the Committee calls attention to what may   be a conflict between Downs and the statutory requirements for an   award of punitive damages in a trespass action.      Because “reasonable doubt” is not defined in Ala. Code § 6-   11-20 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code), it may be appropriate to   instruct the jury on reasonable doubt to draw the distinction be-   tween the terms. One instruction on reasonable doubt is as follows:      A reasonable doubt is a doubt of a fair-minded juror   honestly seeking the truth after careful and impartial   consideration of all the evidence in this case. It is a doubt   based on reason and common sense. A reasonable doubt is not   a notion that is confused or contrary to reason. It is an actual   doubt based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, or a combina-   tion of them. It is a doubt that remains after going over in   your mind the entire case and considering all the evidence. A   reasonable doubt is different from a doubt based on a mere   possibility, or a doubt based on bare imagination, or a doubt   based on guesswork.      References      Chestang v.

Before you can award (name of plaintiff) damages for   emotional distress, (he/she) must prove the following:      1l.a. (That the trespass caused physical injury to (name   of plaintiff)), or,      1. b. (It was reasonably foreseeable to (name of   defendant) that (his/her/its) conduct would place (name of   plaintiff) in the immediate risk of physical harm, and that it   did put (name of plaintiff) in the risk of physical harm), or,      1. c. (That (name of defendant)’s language or other   conduct was insulting, rude, abusive or scornful when (he/   she/it) trespassed on (name of plaintiff)’s property), or,      1.d. (That (name of defendant) knew that (his/her/its)   conduct was a trespass on someone’s property.      If (name of plaintiff) proved these things, you should   award [him/her] damages for the emotional distress.      There is no legal rule or yardstick that tells you how   much money to award for physical pain (and emotional   distress). The amount you decide to award is up to you, but   it must be fair and reasonable, based on sound judgment,   and proved by the evidence. In deciding the amount of the   award, you may consider, among other things, the nature,   severity, and length of time (name of plaintiff) had physical   pain (and emotional distress).      (You should award (name of plaintiff) an amount for   future physical pain (and emotional distress) if (name of      131      APJI 31A.16 ALABAMA PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS      plaintiff) has proved that it is reasonably certain that (he/   she) will have physical pain (and emotional distress) in the   future.)      Notes on Use      The plaintiff can recover emotional distress damages in a   trespass case when the trespass places plaintiff in the zone of   danger, or causes a physical injury, or when the trespass in com-   mitted under circumstances of insult or contumely, or the      defendant’s conduct is wanton.

To determine the value, you should consider the way the   crops were worked, the weather, insects, plant disease, fer-   tilizer, and all other such factors had the crop not been   harmed, less the reasonable cost of gathering, housing, and   marketing that part of the crop that was harmed.      Thus, the measure of damages is the difference in   yield—what the yield would have been had the crop not been   harmed, and the actual yield, less the reasonable cost of   gathering, housing, and marketing that part of the crop   which was lost as a result of the claimed harm.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that the trespass   destroyed some or all of his crops.      When the plaintiff is prevented from planting a crop, see   Johnson v.

An-   other person cannot conduct an activity on his land that   interferes with those rights. If the activity would hurt, harm,   or inconvenience an ordinary, reasonable neighbor, and it   causes harm to his neighbor’s land, the law calls this a   nuisance.      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says defendant (name of   defendant) (state the activity and the effect, e.g., foul odors,   noise, dust, vibrations, pollution of a stream, etc.) and the   condition caused (him/her/it) to lose the use or enjoyment of   (his/her/its) land. (Name of plaintiff) also says the condition   caused (him/her/it) harm (state the claimed harm, e. g., harm   to the land, physical harm, emotional distress).      A nuisance is any condition that causes hurt, inconve-   nience, or harm to another; and it does not matter if the   activity is lawful. The condition must be the kind that would   affect an ordinary, reasonable person; but not one that would   affect only a fussy, picky, difficult, or hard to please person.      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove all of the following:      1. That (name of defendant) caused (describe the condi-   tion of which plaintiff complains);      2. That the condition would affect an ordinary, reason-   able person; and,      3. The condition caused (name of plaintiff) hurt, incon-   venience, or harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proved these things, you will find   for (him/her/it) and determine the amount of money that will   fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her/it) for the harm.      141      APJI 31A.25 ALABAMA PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS      If (name of plaintiff) did not prove these things, you will find   for (name of defendant).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims the defendants   conduct constituted a private nuisance.      Harm and money damage is an element of a claim for private   nuisance.      References   Ala. Code 8§ 6-5-120 to 6-5-125 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      Crouch v.

City of Tuscaloosa, 257 Ala. 574, 60 So. 2d 438   (1952) (statutory definition of a nuisance is declaratory of the com-   mon law and does not supersede the common law on the other   conditions and circumstances that constitute a nuisance under the   common law).      Alabama Power Co. v Stringfellow, 228 Ala. 422, 153 So. 629   (1934).      Noise, to constitute “Nuisance,” must be such as materially   interfered with ordinary comfort of ordinary people, injury   must be substantial, and trifling or occasional noises depend-   ing on ordinary use of property or in pursuance of ordinary   trade or calling do not constitute nuisance.      Higgins v. Bloch, 213 Ala. 209, 104 So. 429 (1925).      The test of inconvenience is “such as would affect ordinary   reasonable men.”      First Avenue Coal & Lumber Co. v. Johnston, 171 Ala. 470, 54   So. 598 (1911), holding that the effect on persons of very delicate   and fastidious taste must not be considered. The action for dam-   ages is founded on the wrongful act in creating or maintaining the   nuisance, and the defendant’s negligence is not an essential   element.      Southern Ry. Co. v.

McLaughlin, 173 Ala. 76, 55 So. 522 (1911). If a private party suf-   fers injury which is only common to the public then he has no   right of action, for he has suffered no injury of his private right.      In support of the right of a private person to recover for special   injury resulting from a public nuisance, see Louisville & N.R. Co.   v. Higginbotham, 153 Ala. 334, 44 So. 872 (1907); Rosser v.   Randolph, 7 Port. 238, 1838 WL 1319 (Ala. 1838); Sloss-Sheffield   Steel & Iron Co. v. Johnson, 147 Ala. 384, 41 So. 907 (1906).      Richards v. Daugherty, 133 Ala. 569, 31 So. 9384 (1902). A   person whose health is endangered by malaria produced from a   dam erected across a stream suffers a particular injury.      Farris v. Dudley, 78 Ala. 124, 1884 WL 768 (1884). The whole   law of nuisance rests upon the common law principle that every   person must use his property as not to injure that of his neighbor.      Nuisances are either public or private. A public nuisance is   one which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its   operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals. A   private nuisance is one limited in its injurious effects to one or a   few individuals. Generally, a public nuisance gives no right of ac-   tion to any individual, but must be abated by a process instituted   in the name of the state. A private nuisance gives a right of action   to the person injured.      West’s Key Number Digest, Nuisance €3(1).      1 Michael L. Roberts & Gregory S.

If you find that the nuisance is permanent and it harmed   (name of plaintiff)’s real property, you will award money   damages for the harm.

Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the plaintiff claims that the   nuisance cannot be abated and it caused harm to his land. The   plaintiff can also recover other damages to the person.      Punitive damages can be recovered. Tyson Foods, Inc. v.   Stevens, 783 So. 2d 804 (Ala. 2000). APJI 31A.15.

Notes on Use      This instruction states only the general rule of damages when   the harm is to land and is not permanent.

Before you can award (name of plaintiff) damages for   emotional distress, (he/she) must prove the following:      la. (That the nuisance caused (name of plaintiff) phys-   ical injury), or,      1b. (It was reasonably foreseeable to (name of defen-   dant) that the condition created by (his/her/its) activity   would place (name of plaintiff) in the immediate risk of phys-   ical harm, and that it did put (name of plaintiff) in the risk   of physical harm), or,      lc. (That the nuisance was accompanied by (name of   defendant)’s behavior that was insulting, rude, abusive or   scornful); and,      2. That the nuisance caused (name of plaintiff) emo-   tional distress.      If (name of plaintiff) proved these things, you should   award (him/her) damages for the emotional distress.      There is no legal rule or yardstick that tells you how   much money to award for physical pain (and mental   anguish). The amount you decide to award is up to you, but   it must be fair and reasonable, based on sound judgment,   and proved by the evidence. In deciding the amount of the   award, you may consider, among other things, the nature,   severity, and length of time (name of plaintiff) had physical   pain (and mental anguish).      (You should award (name of plaintiff) an amount for   future physical pain (and mental anguish) if (name of   plaintiff) has proved that it is reasonably certain that (he/      148      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND APJI 31A.28      she) will have physical pain (and mental anguish) in the   future.)      Notes on Use      The plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress when   the nuisance causes a physical injury. If the nuisance does not   cause a physical injury, the plaintiff can recover damages for emo-   tional distress when the nuisance places him or her in the zone of   danger. (See, Birmingham Realty Co. v. Thomason, 8 Ala. App.   535, 63 So. 65 (1912), or if the nuisance is accompanied by malice,   insult, contumely, or inhumanity, Gregath v. Bates, 359 So. 2d 404   (Ala. Civ. App. 1978).      Element 1 a. should be given when there is substantial evi-   dence that the nuisance caused physical injury, and elements 1 b.   and 1 c. are alternatives when there is no physical injury and   substantial evidence supports either of the alternatives.

(Name of plaintiff) further says (he/she) was hurt   because the workplace was not reasonably safe.      Defendant (name of defendant) says that (name of   plaintiff) was employed by (name of employer), who was an   independent contractor. Because of this, (name of defendant)   says (he/she/it) was not responsible for the safety of the   workplace.      Generally, the property owner is not responsible to an-   other’s employee for workplace safety. But, if the owner has   the right to control what shall be done and how it shall be   done, the owner is responsible for the workplace safety. The   owner does not have to direct the work; it is enough if (he/   she/it) has the right to direct how the work will be done.   However, the fact that the owner has only the right to   supervise or inspect the work to be sure that it is done in ac-   cordance with an agreement, does not make the owner   responsible for workplace safety.      You must decide if (name of defendant) had the right to   direct how the work (name of plaintiff) was doing would be   done. You will consider any agreement between (plaintiffs   employer) and (name of defendant)’s conduct throughout the   progress of the work that shows that (name of defendant)   did or did not control (name of plaintiff)’s work.      If you find that (name of defendant) controlled or had   the right to control (name of plaintiff)’s work, (name of   defendant) had to provide (name of plaintiff) a reasonably   safe workplace. If (name of defendant) did not provide (name   of plaintiff) a reasonably safe place to work and if this fail-   ure caused (name of plaintiff)’s harm, then you will find for   (name of plaintiff) and determine the amount of money that   will fairly and reasonably compensate (him/her) for the      156      TRESPASS, OWNERS & OCCUPIERS OF LAND APJI 31A.35      harm. If (name of defendant) did not have to provide a rea-   sonably safe place to work, you will find for (name of   defendant).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the injury is caused by work condi-   tions that arose during the contract work and when there is a   factual dispute whether a premises owner retained the right to   control the manner in which an independent contractor performs   work. In the absence of a non-delegable duty, the general rule is   that a premises owner owes no duty of care to employees of an in-   dependent contractor about working conditions that arise during   the progress of the work on the contract. The general rule does not   apply, however, if the premises owner retained or reserved the   right to control the manner in which the independent contractor   performed its work.      If the injury is caused by a condition of the land itself, then   instruct on 31.00, 31.01, and 31.04 (if applicable).

This claim   is made under the Alabama Extended Manufacturers’ Li-   ability Doctrine.      2.

This claim is known as a negligence claim.      3. (Name of plaintiff) says that (name of defendant)   wantonly (made/designed/sold/distributed/supplied/   marketed) the (name the product), and caused the (harm/   death). This claim is known as a wantonness claim.      4. (Name of plaintiff) says that (name of defendant) gave   a promise, known in the law as “a warranty,” to (him/her/   name of deceased) about the (use/features/suitability) of the   (name the product), and that the promise or warranty was   broken, resulting in (harm/death). This claim is known as a   breach of warranty claim.      (Name of defendant) denies that these claims are true.      I will now explain each of (name of plaintiff)’s claims   and the defenses raised by (name of defendant). You must   decide each claim separately.      162      PRODUCTS LIABILITY—AEMLD   Notes on Use      Use this introductory instruction in a product liability action   when the plaintiff presents several separate legal theories. If the   plaintiff only makes one claim, ignore this instruction and use the   instructions relating to that claim.      The claims are presented in this volume in the following order:   Alabama Extended Manufacturer’s Liability Doctrine, Negligence,   Wantonness, and Breach of Warranty. By listing the claims in this   manner, the Committee makes no recommendation about the or-   der they must be presented to the jury.      References      The Alabama Extended Manufacturer’s Liability Doctrine does   not subsume all other causes of action based on a product failure.   Tillman v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 871 So. 2d 28 (Ala. 2003)   holds that the common-law actions for negligence and wantonness   are not subsumed by AEMLD. Spain v. Brown & Williamson   Tobacco Corp., 872 So.2d 101, 111 (Ala. 2003) holds that a claim of   “breach of implied warranty of merchantability is separate and   distinct from an AEMLD claim and is viable to redress an injury   caused by an unreasonably dangerous product.”      Vesta Fire Ins.

You must decide whether   the product was defective at the time it left the possession of   (name of defendant).      Notes on Use      Use this instruction to define the term defective in most cases.   The cases use various language when defining the term. Therefore,   “there may be certain plaintiffs’ theories that will require alterna-   tive or additional definitions of ‘defective,’ [however] those cases   should be the exception rather than the rule.” Taylor v. General   Motors Corp., 707 So. 2d 198, 201, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 15126   (Ala. 1997).      References      The Alabama Supreme Court, in one of the original cases   creating the cause of action of Alabama Extended Manufacturer’s   Liability Doctrine, stated a defect was “that which renders a prod-   uct ‘unreasonably dangerous,’ that is, not fit for the ordinary   purposes intended.” Atkins v. American Motors Corp., 335 So. 2d   134, 142, 19 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 756 (Ala. 1976). Casrell v. Altec   Industries, Inc., 335 So. 2d 128 (Ala. 1976) both refer to § 402A,   Restatement (Second) of Torts, Comment i, that defines “unreason-   ably dangerous”:      The rule stated in this Section applies only where the defec-   tive condition of the product makes it unreasonably dangerous   to the user or consumer. Many products cannot possibly be   made entirely safe for all consumption, and any food or drug   necessarily involves some risk of harm, if only from over-   consumption. Ordinary sugar is a deadly poison to diabetics,   and castor oil found use under Mussolini as an instrument of   torture. This is not what is meant by ‘unreasonably dangerous’   in this Section. The article sold must be dangerous to an extent   beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary   consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge com-   mon to the community as to its characteristics. Good whiskey   is not unreasonably dangerous merely because it will make   people drunk, and is especially dangerous to alcoholics; but      164      PRODUCTS LIABILITY—AEMLD      bad whiskey containing a dangerous amount of fusel oil, is   unreasonably dangerous. Good tobacco is not unreasonably   dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harm-   ful; but tobacco containing something like marijuana may be   unreasonably dangerous. Good butter is not unreasonably   dangerous merely because, if such be the case, it deposits cho-   lesterol in the arteries and leads to hart attacks; but bad but-   ter, contaminated with poisonous fish oil, is unreasonably   dangerous.      The Supreme Court has not required the plaintiff to prove the   specific defect that caused the injury. “[P]lroof of the specific defect,   1.e., the exact act, omission, process, construction, etc., resulting in   the product’s failing its intended use, is not required,. . .[but] the   fact of an injury, of course, does not establish the presence of a   defect.” Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc. v. Haven Hills Farm, Inc., 395   So. 2d 991, 994-95 (Ala. 1981) (per curiam), distinguished, Ex   parte General Motors Corp., 769 So. 2d 903 (Ala. 1999). “If a prod-   uct is unreasonably dangerous, it is necessarily defective, and the   consumer should not be required to prove defectiveness as a sepa-   rate matter.” Casrell v.

Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the defendant says it was only an   occasional seller, or denies that it is in the business of manufactur-   ing, supplying, distributing or selling the product in question, or   that type of product.      References      Atkins v. American Motors Corp., 335 So. 2d 134, 141, 19   U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 756 (Ala. 1976), listed the elements of an   AEMLD claim, and stated: “the seller was engaged in the business   of selling such a product.” The Court then explained “that   defendants who are ordinarily engaged in the business of market-   ing products should be liable for the foreseeable harm proximately   resulting from defective conditions in the products which make   them unreasonably dangerous.”      AEMLD “excludes isolated or occasional sellers or lessors.”   Baugh v. Bradford, 529 So. 2d 996, 999, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P   11913, 6 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d 1113 (Ala. 1988). The Supreme Court   quoted from the Comments to Restatement (Second) of Torts   § 402A (1965):      f. Business of selling. The rule stated in this Section ap-   plies to any person engaged in the business of selling products   for use or consumption. It therefore applies to any manufac-   turer of such a product, to any wholesale or retail dealer or   distributor and to the operator of a restaurant. It is not neces-   sary that the seller be engaged solely in the business of selling   such products. Thus the rule applied to the owner of a motion   picture theatre who sells popcorn or ice cream, either for   consumption on the premises or in packages to be taken home.      This rule does not, however, apply to. . .the owner of an      167            automobile who, on one occasion, sells it to his neighbor, or   even sells it to a dealer in used cars, and this even though he   is fully aware that the dealer plans to resell it. The basis for   the rule is the ancient one of the special responsibility for the   safety of the public undertaken by one who enters into the   business of supplying human beings with products which may   endanger the safety of their persons and property, and the   forced reliance upon the undertaking on the part of those who   purchase such goods.      See also, Rhodes v. Tractor & Equipment Co., 677 So. 2d 194,   Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 14775 (Ala. 1995) (defendant was in the   business when he sold used tires from time to time); Dillard v.

Furon Co., 812 So. 2d 273, Prod.   Liab. Rep.

Cessna Aircraft Co., 365 So. 2d   966, 968 (Ala. 1978). A technical “sale” is not required. It is suf-   ficient if the defendant put the product into the stream of   commerce. “When a product is placed in the ‘stream of commerce,’   the marketing cycle as it were, whether by demonstration, lease,   free sample or sale, the doctrine should attach.”      Hicks v.

References      The mere fact that a product has been modified subsequent to   the sale does not always relieve a manufacturer of liability. An es-   sential element of an AEMLD claim is proof that the product   reached the consumer without substantial change in the condition   in which it was sold. Clarke Industries, Inc. v. Home Indem.

However, the mere fact that a   product has been altered or modified does not necessarily relieve   the manufacturer or seller of liability. Johnson v. Niagara Mach.   Tool Works, 555 So. 2d 88, 91, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 12352   (Ala. 1989). A manufacturer or seller remains liable if the altera-   tion or modification did not in fact cause the injury, Johnson, 555   So. 2d at 91 (quoting Industrial Chemical & Fiberglass Corp. v.   Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co., 475 So. 2d 472, 476 (Ala. 1985); Bullen   v. Roto Finishing Systems, 435 So. 2d 1256 (Ala. 1983); Brown v.

Alteration of a product which is not foreseeable is an interven-      169            ing and superseding cause of the injury and relieves the seller   from liability under AEMLD. Morguson v. 3M Co., 857 So. 2d 796   (Ala. 2003).      The Casrell and Atkins decisions state that the condition of   the product should be determined at the time “which it is sold.”   However, it is clear that the sale to plaintiff may occur long after   the product leaves the possession of the manufacturer. A defendant   manufacturer may defeat plaintiffs claim by showing that the   defect occurred while the product was in the possession or control   of the distributor or retailer. Johnson v. Niagara Mach. and Tool   Works, 555 So. 2d 88, 91, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 12352 (Ala.   1989). Defect is determined at the time the product leaves the   manufacturer’s exclusive control.

The trial court   should also give the necessary instructions defining “manufac-   turer,” “user,” “defect,” “without substantial change,” and “safer   and practical alternative design.”      In cases when the plaintiff is trying AEMLD, breach of war-   ranty, negligence and/or wantonness claims together, the Commit-   tee recommends that the trial court begin the substantive instruc-   tions by giving Introduction—Multiple Counts first,   before reading any of the instructions on the individual claims.   When instructing the jury on the AEMLD claim, the trial court   should give AEMLD—Factual Elements, and then the   new charge or charges on the appropriate AEMLD claims.      References      King v.

This was probably the result of the decision in General Motors   Corp. v. Edwards, 482 So. 2d 1176, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 10888   (Ala. 1985), distinguished and overruled on other grounds,   Schwartz v. Volvo American Corp., 554 So. 2d 927 (Ala. 1989), that      175            first recognized that a cause of action could be maintained when   the plaintiff alleged that the defective condition of the motor vehi-   cle, and not just the actual automobile accident itself, caused his   or her injuries. This was known as the “crashworthiness doctrine,”   the “second collision doctrine,” and sometimes the “enhanced injury   doctrine.” The Edwards decision held that in order to recover dam-   ages against an automobile manufacturer on a “crashworthiness”   claim, the plaintiff must prove the following elements:      I. That the plaintiff (or one upon whose behalf he brings suit)   was involved in an automobile accident.      II. That an automobile involved in that accident was manufac-   tured by the defendant manufacturer.      III. That, at the time of the accident, that automobile was   substantially unchanged since leaving the manufacturer.      IV. That the automobile was defective. That is to say, that it   did not meet the reasonable expectations of an ordinary   consumer as to its safety because it was unreasonably danger-   ous, i.e., not fit for its intended purpose, which is to travel the   streets, highways, and other thoroughfares. In order to prove   defectiveness, the plaintiff must prove that a safer, practical,   alternative design was available to the manufacturer at the   time it manufactured the automobile. The existence of a safer,   practical, alternative design must be proved by showing that:      (a) The plaintiffs injuries would have been elimi-   nated or in some way reduced by use of the   alternative design, and that;      (b) Taking into consideration such factors as the   intended use of the vehicle, its styling, cost, and   desirability, its safety aspects, the foreseeability   of the particular accident, the likelihood of injury,   and the probable seriousness of the injury if that   accident occurred, the obviousness of the defect,   and the manufacturer’s ability to eliminate the   defect, the utility of the alternative design out-   weighed the utility of the design actually used.

Marinelli, 628 So. 2d 378, Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH)   P 13772 (Ala. 1993), which held:      In Edwards, this Court held that in a case involving a   crashworthiness claim the plaintiffs burden in proving causation   is to present proof “that the defect in the automobile proximately   caused his injuries.” Jd. Instruction 32.22, Alabama Pattern Jury   Instructions: Civil, the crashworthiness charge, sets out the   plaintiffs burden in proving causation, in identical language.   Likewise, the plaintiffs burden in proving causation under APJI   Instruction 32.08, the AEMLD charge, is to present proof that the   plaintiff was injured or damaged “as a proximate result of the   defendant’s placing on the market [an] unreasonably dangerous   [product].” Consequently, the plaintiffs burden in establishing   causation is identical whether the theory of liability is the AEMLD   (that the defect proximately caused the injury) or the crashworthi-   ness doctrine. Contrary to Volkswagen’s position, neither doctrine   requires proof of accident causation; rather, both doctrines focus   on the alleged defect as being the proximate cause of the injury or   damage. Id. at 385.      The plaintiff must prove “a safer, practical, alternative design   was available to the manufacturer at the time it manufactured the   [product].” General Motors Corp. v.

To prove a safer, practical, alternative   design, plaintiff must prove (1) that some alternative design   existed that would have eliminated or reduced his injuries, and (2)   that the utility of the alternative design outweighed the utility of   the design actually used.

S.R. Smith, Inc., 578   So. 2d 1285 (Ala. 1991).      The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A, comment k (1965),   discusses “unavoidably unsafe products,” and defines them as   “products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are   quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary   use . . .. Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by   proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreason-   ably dangerous.” Ex parte Chevron Chemical Co., 720 So. 2d 922,   Prod. Liab. Rep. (CCH) P 15244 (Ala. 1998), held that under the   AEMLD, “unreasonably dangerous” includes the concept that the   plaintiff is aware of the danger of the product. So, if the user is   aware of the dangerousness of the product, the product is not   “unreasonably dangerous.” For similar statements, see Stone v.   Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, 447 So. 2d 1301 (Ala. 1984)   (“in the case of an ‘unavoidably unsafe’ yet properly prepared pre-   scription drug, the adequacy of the accompanying warning   determines whether the drug, as marketed, is defective, or   unreasonably dangerous.”); and Purvis v.

Negligence by the plaintiff in the use of the product in ques-   tion is a defense to an AEMLD claim, but plaintiffs negligence in   causing the accident is not a defense to an AEMLD claim when the   alleged contributory negligence does not relate to plaintiffs use of   the product.      The second sentence of the instruction recognizes that contrib-   utory negligence may be based on a negligent failure to act, or   upon a negligent action. The trial judge should use only the ap-   plicable part of the instruction. In some cases, it may be necessary   to instruct on a negligent failure to act and a negligent act by the   plaintiff.

A statement of fact or a promise about the product   made by the seller that is part of the sale; or      2. Any description of the (name the product), including   any sample or model, that is part of the sale.      It is not necessary that the words “warrant” or “guaran-   tee” be used, or that (name of defendant) have a specific   intention to make a warranty. However, a statement of value   or opinion by (name of defendant) about the (name the prod-   uct) does not create an express warranty.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction with to define an express   warranty.      In cases when proof of privity is required, the court must insert   this sentence into the instruction:      (Name of plaintiff) must prove to your reasonable satisfaction   that (name of defendant) sold the (name the product) to (name of   plaintiff).

(His/her/its) conduct caused the harm if (1) the conduct   naturally and probably brought about the harm and (2) the   harm would not have happened without the conduct.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when it is necessary to instruct on causa-   tion (proximate cause).      The bench and bar is accustomed to the language “proximate   cause”. The word “proximate” is a legal term of art that is a dif-   ficult concept for a jury, and for this reason it is omitted from the   instruction. Michael L. Roberts & Gregory S. Cusimano, Alabama   Tort Law § 7.03 (5th ed. 2010) (the most succinct statement of   proximate cause is “[t]he cause of harm is that cause that naturally   and probably brings about the harm.”).      Dram Shop Actions. Ala. Code § 6-5-71(a) (1975) (West’s Al-   abama Code) states: “Every wife, . . ., or other person who shall   be injured. . . by any intoxicated person or in consequence of the   intoxication of any person. . ..” This language is the basis of an   argument there is a relaxed causation requirement in some Dram   Shop actions.

Each (person’s, entity’s, etc.) conduct is a cause   of harm if it naturally and probably brings about the harm.      (Add if appropriate): The fact that one or more (person,   entity, etc.) is not a defendant in this case does not relieve   the other (person, entity, etc.) of responsibility for the harm.

Federal law does, in some cases, and may in others, pre-   empt state law tort claims against railroads. See generally 1   Ally W.

Reasonable care is the care that a reasonably prudent   operator would have used in a similar situation. An operator   does not use reasonable care when (he/she) does something   that a reasonably prudent operator would not do in a similar   situation, or (he/she) fails to do something that a reasonably   prudent operator would have done in a similar situation.      Approved Nov. 8, 2019      Notes on Use      The trial judge may have to instruct the jury to determine   whether the crossing is public or private. Whether the crossing is   public or private is determined by the nature of its use and not the   frequency with which the public uses it Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co.   v.

Reasonable care requires a person must stop, look and   listen before (he/she) crosses a track. (He/she) must stop   close enough to the track under the circumstances to best   use (his/her) sight and hearing to determine if (he/she) can   safely cross. However, (he/she) need not stop so close to put   (himself/herself) in danger from a passing train.      After the stop, if (he/she) did stop, (he/she) must   continue to look and listen as (he/she) attempts to cross. (He/   she) must continue to look and listen to determine if (he/she)   can safely continue to cross the track.      If (name of defendant) reasonably satisfies you from the   evidence that (name of plaintiff) did not use reasonable care,   you must find for (name of defendant).      Approved March 6, 2020      Notes on Use      This instruction states the common law rule in Alabama about   stop, look and listen.      A person is also under a statutory duty, Ala. Code § 32-5A-150   (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). Ridgeway v. CSX Transp., Inc., 723   So. 2d 600, 606 (Ala. 1998). The failure to stop, look, and listen is   an affirmative defense.      Generally, when a person does not stop, look, and listen, and   that failure causes a collision with a train, the failure is, as a mat-   ter of law, treated as the sole proximate cause of his or her harm.   However, an unusually dangerous crossing may present an excep-   tion to the general rule. Ridgeway at 607. Under Alabama common   law, an unusually dangerous crossing or a hazardous crossing is   one that that cannot “be traversed safely through the exercise of   ordinary care.” Ridgeway at 608.      232      RAILROADS      References      Ala. Code § 32-5A-150 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) states in   part: A person driving a vehicle “that approaches a grade crossing”   . . “shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the   nearest rail of such railroad” under the circumstances stated in   subsections (1) through (4).

Populous Crossing Doctrine      The populous crossing doctrine plays a role in determining   whether the operator’s conduct was wanton. When a train operator   knows or should have known it is likely that people may be cross-   ing the track at the time and place the plaintiff was harmed, the   operator must use precautions to look out for and warn persons   who may be in peril crossing the tracks. If the operator failed to   use these precautions, the failure may show he or she acted with   reckless indifference to the consequences of that conduct. The doc-   trine applies in the country as well as urban areas. It does not ap-   ply to public crossings.      One characteristic of a populous crossing is a surrounding   dense population. However, this alone is not enough. Louisville &   N.R. Co. v. Heidtmueller, 206 Ala. 29, 30, 89 So. 191, 192 (1921).   The public must use the roadbed “in such large numbers, and with   such sufficient frequency and regularity, that the trainmen will be   held to a knowledge of the probable consequences for non-   compliance with precautions” such as a reasonable rate of speed,      234      RAILROADS      keeping a lookout, or sounding a signal or warning. Id. In short,   “fi]t is the likelihood of peril to the safety of passers-by, known to   defendant’s employees, that makes the duty [to use precautions],   not the place itself.” Haley v. Kansas City, M. & B.R. Co., 113 Ala.   640, 21 So. 357 (1897).      Whether the crossing is a populous crossing is generally a jury   question.      See, Negligence—Definition.

A person invades another’s privacy if (he/she/it) inten-   tionally intrudes or pries into that person’s private activities   and does it in a way that would outrage or would cause   mental suffering, shame, or humiliation to a person of   ordinary sensibilities.      (Name of plaintiff) says (name of defendant):      (Intruded on (name of plaintiff)’s physical (solitude/   seclusion));      (Publicized private information about (name of plaintiff)   and the publicity violated ordinary decency);      (Put (name of plaintiff) in a false light in the public eye);   or      (Violated (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity).      Approved Jan. 8, 2016      Notes on Use      The trial judge should instruct on only the alternative theory   that plaintiff bases his or her claim. However, the plaintiff can   plead the defendant’s conduct falls within more than one branch of   invasion of privacy. See, S.B. v. Saint James School, 959 So. 2d 72,   222 Ed. Law Rep. 444 (Ala. 2006) (plaintiff claimed the defendant’s   conduct was a wrongful intrusion into private matters, publicized   private information, and put the plaintiffs in a false light).      Dean Thomas M. Cooley described the right of privacy as “the   right to be let alone.” Thomas M. Cooley, Cooley on Torts § 29 (2d   ed. 1888). The right included the right not to have one’s likeness or   personality appropriated for commercial use, and a violation of   this right is stated as the fourth alternative claim in   (3d ed. 2015).      247            The 2015 Alabama Legislature enacted the Alabama Right of   Publicity Act, 2015 Ala. Acts 188, Ala. Code § 6-5-770 (1975)   (West’s Alabama Code), and the act “provides protection for an in-   dividual’s name, image and likeness, among other attributes, from   commercial exploitation without consent.” Lee Armstrong and   Cooper Shattuck, Alabama’s Right of Publicity Act, 76 Ala. Law.   256 (July 2015). The authors state one of the Alabama Law   Institute drafting committee’s guiding principles was to “[m]Jake   the act consistent with Alabama Common Law” and they state the   act should “successfully clarify existing common law and provide   answers to right-of-publicity questions in Alabama.” The act was   effective August 1, 2015.      References   Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 562D, 562E (1977).      S.B. v. Saint James School, 959 So. 2d 72, 222 Ed. Law Rep.   444 (Ala. 2006). Plaintiff claimed wrongful intrusion, the defendant   publicized private matters, and false light invasion of privacy.      Regions Bank v. Plott, 897 So. 2d 239, 53 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d   979 (Ala. 2004). Plaintiff claimed the bank’s stamped notations on   returned checks placed the plaintiff in a false light.      Butler v. Town of Argo, 871 So. 2d 1 (Ala. 2003). Plaintiff   claimed false light invasion of privacy.      Rosen v. Montgomery Surgical Center, 825 So. 2d 735 (Ala.   2001). Plaintiff claimed publication of private medical information   (that she had an emergency appendectomy) violated ordinary   decency.      Johnston v. Fuller, 706 So. 2d 700 (Ala. 1997). Plaintiff claimed   defendant wrongfully intruded into his private affairs during an   investigation of a claimed threat against the plaintiff, and plaintiff   claimed the defendant gave publicity to private information   contained in the investigative file.      Fitch v. Voit, 624 So. 2d 542, 542-543 (Ala. 1993). Alabama   does not recognize a claim for relational right of privacy. But see,   J.C. v. WALA-TV, Inc., 675 So. 2d 360 (Ala. 1996) (parents brought   a claim for invasion of their minor child’s privacy). See, Hogin v.   Cottingham, 533 So. 2d 525 (Ala. 1988) (acknowledged parent’s   right to claim violation of child’s privacy). See, Holloway v. Ameri-   can Media, Inc., 947 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1265-1268 (N.D. Ala. 2013)   (discusses the personal nature of the claim for invasion of privacy).      Johnson v. Corporate Special Services, Inc., 602 So. 2d 385   248      VIOLATION OF PRIVACY/PUBLICITY      (Ala. 1992). Plaintiff, a workers’ compensation claimant, claimed   wrongful intrusion based on defendant’s surveillance of the   plaintiff.      Hogin v. Cottingham, 533 So. 2d 525 (Ala. 1988). Wrongful   intrusion by a lawyer who, acting for a client, sought the identity   of an elementary school student.      Minnifield v. Ashcraft, 903 So. 2d 818 (Ala. Civ. App. 2004).   Commercial appropriation by tattoo artist.      Phillips v. Smalley Maintenance Services, Inc., 435 So. 2d 705   (Ala. 1983).

Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says defendant (name of   defendant) violated (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity.   (Name of plaintiff) says (name of defendant) (used/caused   (name) to use) (specify the attribute) in (specify how it was   used), and (name of defendant) did not have consent to do   SO.      (Name of defendant) says:   ((He/she/it) had (name of plaintiff)’s consent.)      ((Name of plaintiff/name of plaintiffs agent) authorized   the use.)      (The use was a fair use of (name of plaintiff)’s (specify   the attribute).)      (The use is privileged under (the First Amendment to   the United States Constitution/ Alabama Constitution). )      The general rule of law is (name of plaintiff) has a right   in (his/her) name, personality, or likeness and the right to   control its use for commercial and other purposes. When   (name of defendant) uses (name of plaintiff)’s name, person-   ality, or likeness for (his/her/its) benefit and without consent,   the use may violate (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity.      To recover, (name of plaintiff) must reasonably satisfy   you from the evidence all of the following:      1. (Name of defendant) (used/caused (name) to use)   (name of plaintiff)’s (specify the attribute);      266      VIOLATION OF PRIVACY/PUBLICITY      2. (Name of defendant) used (name of plaintiff)’s   (specify the attribute) to (state how it was used);      3. (Name of defendant)’s use of (name of plaintiff)’s   (specify the attribute) would identify (name of plaintiff) to   an ordinary, reasonable viewer or listener; (and,)      4. (Name of defendant) did not have (name of plaintiff/   name of plaintiffs agent)’s consent to use (his/her) (specify   the attribute) (; and,)      (5. (Name of defendant)’s use of (name of plaintiff)’s   (specify the attribute) was not a fair use.)      If (name of plaintiff) proved all these things you will   find for (him/her), and then you determine the amount of   money to award (name of plaintiff).      If (name of plaintiff) did not prove all these things, you   will find for (name of defendant).      Approved April 8, 2016      Notes on Use      The 2015 Alabama Legislature enacted the Alabama Right of   Publicity Act, 2015 Ala. Acts 188, and it will be codified as Ala.   Code §§ 6-5-770 to 774 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      The Act “provides protection for an individual’s name, image   and likeness, among other attributes, from commercial exploita-   tion without consent.” Lee Armstrong and Cooper Shattuck,   Alabama’s Right of Publicity Act, 76 Ala. Law. 256 (July 2015). It   “supersedes prior inconsistent common law on the unauthorized   commercial use of a person’s indicia of identity, but does not   preempt any other form of common law ‘right of privacy.’ ” Section   6-5-771 Ala. cmt. Armstrong and Shattuck state one of the Ala-   bama Law Institute drafting committee’s guiding principles was to   “[mjake the act consistent with Alabama Common Law’, and they   also state the Act should “successfully clarify existing common law   and provide answers to right-of-publicity questions in Alabama.”   The Act was effective August 1, 2015.      In the right of publicity case, “[i]t is the value of the plaintiffs   267            name or likeness that must be taken, not the mere name itself. 2   Rodney A. Smolla, Law of Defamation § 10:6 (Dec. 2015). See,   Schifano v. Greene County Greyhound Park, Inc., 624 So. 2d 178,   181 (Ala. 1993) (summary judgment on commercial appropriation   claim affirmed because there “was no unique quality or value in   the [plaintiffs’] likeness that would result in commercial profit to   [defendant] simply from using a photograph that included them   unidentified and seated in a group.”)      Ala. Code § 6-5-771(1) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) requires   the attribute used identify the plaintiff to an ordinary, reasonable   viewer or listener. The requirement is expressed in element 3 in   the instruction. This is akin to the requirement in a defamation   action that the communication be of and concerning (about) the   plaintiff.      Ala. Code § 6-5-773 (2) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) defines   fair use, and if the defendant offers evidence of fair use the burden   is on the plaintiff to prove it was not a fair use. This requirement   is expressed in element 5 and set off in parenthesis. The trial   judge will not give element 5 if the defendant does not interject ev-   idence of fair use.      Ala. Code § 6-5-773 (f) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) “is an   articulation of the first sale doctrine recognized in Allison v.

CODE § 6-5-   773 (1975) (WEST’S ALABAMA   CODE) [PL]      There are circumstances when (name of defendant) can   use (name of plaintiff)’s name, personality or likeness for   (his/her/its) benefit without (name of plaintiff)’s consent.      (Name of defendant) says (his/her/its) use of (name of   plaintiff)’s (specify the attribute) was a fair use because   (state why). If you find (name of defendant) used (name of   plaintiff)’s (specify the attribute) without (his/her) consent   and (name of defendant) used it for (his/her/its) benefit, you   must determine whether its use was fair or not.      (Name of defendant) does not have to prove the use was   a fair use; (name of plaintiff) must prove (name of defen-   dant)’s use of (name of plaintiff)’s (specify the attribute) was   not a fair use.      Approved April 8, 2016      Notes on Use      Use this instruction to specify fair use issues and instruct   about the burden of proof on these issues.      The Alabama Right of Publicity Act identifies fair use in three   circumstances: use of the plaintiffs attribute in a public interest   work and to advertise and promote the work itself; use in an   artistic or expressive work and to advertise and promote the work;   and use in another person’s campaign for public office. Ala. Code   § 6-5-773 (b), (c), (e) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). Public interest   works and artistic works are defined by a list of examples of each;   however, the list of public interest works is exclusive, but the list   of artistic works is not. The act recognizes the First Amendment   and Ala. Const. art. I, § 4 may also protect the user. Id. § 6-5-773   (a).      Fair use is defensive matter; it is not an affirmative defense.      The act expresses limitations on fair use of a work and the      270      VIOLATION OF PRIVACY/PUBLICITY      advertising and promotion of the work. First, if the plaintiff proves   that an artistic work is “such a replica as to constitute a copy of   the person’s indicia of identity for the purposes of trade” then nei-   ther the use of the work or advertising or promotion of the work is   fair use. Section 6-5-773 (b). However, the validity of this limita-   tion may be subject to further scrutiny under the First Amend-   ment and Ala. Const. art. I, § 4. Section 6-5-773 (a), (b).      The second limitation applies to public works and artistic   works, and it is stated in § 6-5-7738 (c). Under § 6-5-773 (b), use of   the plaintiffs attribute to advertise or promote the public interest   work itself is fair use. However, the use is not fair use if the   plaintiff proves that “his or her indicia of identity is directly con-   nected to and affirmatively used in a commercial manner to   advertise, promote, or endorse a product, good, or service.” See,   e.g., Kyser-Smith v. Upscale Communications, Inc., 873 F. Supp.   1519 (M.D. Ala. 1995). It is not a fair use to use the plaintiffs at-   tribute to advertise or promote an artistic work if the plaintiff   proves that “his or her indicia of identity is directly connected to   and affirmatively used in a commercial manner to advertise,   promote, or endorse a product, good, or service.” See, e. g., Tanner   v. Ebbole, 88 So. 3d 856 (Ala. Civ. App. 2011).      The act has not been construed by the Alabama appellate   courts, and the Committee suggests no Plain Language definitions   of certain terms and phrases used in the Act. The comment to § 6-   5-773 states “[t]he phrase ‘for purposes of trade’ in subsection (b) is   based on the definition set out in Restatement (Third) of Unfair   Competition § 47 (1995) and cmt. c.” However, Alabama has not   judicially adopted this aspect of the Restatement. Esch v. Univer-   sal Pictures Co., Inc., 39 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1074, 97 U.S.P.Q.2d   1237, 2010 WL 5600989 *5 (N.D. Ala. 2010), not reported in F.   Supp. 2d. Other terms or phrases that require Plain Language   definitions are: affirmatively used, used in a commercial manner,   trade purpose, and commercial medium.      Ala. Code § 6-5-773 (f) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) “is an   articulation of the first sale doctrine recognized in Allison v.   Vintage Sports Plaques, 136 F. 3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1998).” Section   6-5-773 Ala. cmt. The court of appeals opined the Supreme Court   of Alabama would apply the first sale doctrine to Alabama’s com-   mon law cause of action for invasion of privacy for appropriation of   some element of the plaintiffs personality for commercial use.      Public interest work.   A public interest work is a news, public affairs, or public inter-      271            est account, political speech or a political campaign, live or   prerecorded broadcast or streaming of a sporting event or photos,   clips, or highlights included in broadcasts or streaming of sports   news or talk shows, or documentaries, or any advertising or promo-   tion of the same.      Artistic or expressive work.      An artistic or expressive work such as a live performance,   work of art, literary work, theatrical work, musical work, audiovi-   sual work, motion picture, film, television program, radio program   or the like (artistic work), or any advertising or promotion of the   same. (Emphasis added to denote the list is not inclusive).      Political campaign.      “It is not a fair use and is a violation of [§ 6-5-772] if a person’s   [attribute] is used, without such person’s permission, in a manner   stating or implying that such person has endorsed or supports a   candidate for public office.

CODE § 6-5-773 (G) (1975)   (WEST’S ALABAMA CODE) [PL]      (Name of defendant) says (name of plaintiff) cannot re-   cover because (he/she) filed this lawsuit too late.      (Name of plaintiff) must have filed the lawsuit within   two years of (name of defendant)’s conduct that may have   violated (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity.      (Name of defendant) must reasonably satisfy you from   the evidence that (name of plaintiff) did not file the lawsuit   within the two year time limit. (If (he/she/it) proved this, you   will find for (name of defendant).)      The Discovery Rule      If (name of defendant) proves (name of plaintiff) did not   file the lawsuit within the two year time period, you will find   it was filed in time if (name of plaintiff) proves three things.      (Name of plaintiff) must prove to your reasonable satis-   faction from the evidence that:      1. (He/she) did not discover within the two year time   period facts that showed (name of defendant) may have   violated (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity;      2. (He/she) could not have reasonably discovered within   the two year time period facts that reasonably would have   shown (him/her) that (name of defendant) may have violated   (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity; and,      3. (He/she) filed the lawsuit within six months from   the time that (he/she) discovered the facts or reasonably   should have discovered facts that (name of defendant) may   have violated (name of plaintiff)’s right of publicity, which-   ever is shorter.      278      VIOLATION OF PRIVACY/PUBLICITY      If (name of plaintiff) proved all these things you will   find (name of plaintiff) timely filed the lawsuit.      Approved April 8, 2016      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the defendant pleaded the affirma-   tive defense of the statute of limitation. It can also be used when   the plaintiff claims the lawsuit was filed within the six months   discovery rule of the Alabama Right of Publicity Act.      When the plaintiff claims the lawsuit was filed within the six   months savings provision, the instruction is limited to the   circumstance:      1. The plaintiff did not file the lawsuit within the two   year statute of limitations; and      2. The plaintiff can prove he/she/it could not reasonably   have discovered the infringement within those two   years; and      3. The plaintiff has evidence that he/she/it filed the   lawsuit within six months of being on reasonable notice   of facts that did (or reasonably should have) put him/   her/it on notice of a right of publicity claim; and      4. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit no later than four years   after the act or omission giving rise to the right of   publicity claim.      Reference   Ala Code § 6-5-7738 (g) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) states:      (g) Any action brought pursuant to this act shall be com-   menced within two years from the act or omission giving rise   to the claim. If the cause of action is not discovered and could   not reasonably have been discovered within that time period,   then the action may be commenced within six months from   the date of such discovery or the date of discovery of facts   which would reasonably lead to such discovery, whichever is   earlier. In no event may the action be commenced more than      279            four years after the act or omission giving rise to the claim.      280      CHAPTER 36 [RESERVED]      281      _¢   4 oo 7   }) ; :   ; a <   24 Pei =   f Ly ,                       i]   i OP ii . ot ‘Ab Ng   j mh ral   iy «7S ¥ Ao nie vain   a a fel rE a   ian ‘y   '   ‘   t   i -   — |   | j , Bf   | I y ai   i   i?   j   f   —   =" _   4   ‘ ®   ' i me Me vue i   BAS OR: hey wit uhd hahaha Get at # <n ‘ , 4 ‘ ‘i th od ty   1] : tim id * U |   ’ i=   " 1   i   i   ‘ i   ? , {   de i\ .   y) it j   H in ‘ { f it   4 ; | 7 tip 9! ”" i 4 &   : Alig a ie aro) ay   7 ivi qi at ay if Wo      a PY «, : 7   a ll ; fai Th oe i te   } Nar | 1 f   .

No inferences are to   be drawn by you from the fact that the court has supplied   you with these forms, or from the order in which the court   reads them to you. When you have reached a verdict you will   select and complete the form which corresponds to your   verdict and which is to be signed by your foreman. All twelve   of you must agree on any verdict which you return to the   court.      Notes on Use      This is an introduction to the use of the forms of verdicts which   follow. A unanimous verdict is mentioned. However, Ala. R. Civ. P   48 permits the parties to agree to accept a non-unanimous verdict.   See, Non-unanimous verdict by Agreement.      All forms of verdicts read to the Jury by the court should be   furnished to the Jury and contain the style of the case giving the   full correct names of the parties.      If more than one count is submitted to the jury, and the jury   returns a general verdict, the judgment entered upon the verdict   will be reversed if a directed verdict should have been granted as   to one of the counts submitted to the jury. See Alfa Mut. Ins. Co. v.   Roush, 723 So. 2d 1250, 1257 (Ala. 1998); see also Larrimore v.   Dubose, 827 So. 2d 60 (Ala. 2001).

DEFENDANT’S VERDICT      If, after a full and fair consideration of all the evidence   you find for the defendants on all claims, then you should   use the following verdict form:      “We, the jury, find in favor of the defendant and against   the plaintiff on all claims.      Foreperson”      Notes on Use      Special verdict forms may be appropriate when separate   claims against several defendants are tried together. The jury   should have the discretion to determine whether the plaintiff has   proven the claim against the separate defendants. Further, the   jury should have the discretion to determine whether to award pu-   nitive damages against only one defendant when separate claims   are alleged against each defendant.      If more than one count is submitted to the jury, and the jury   returns a general verdict, the judgment entered upon the verdict   will be reversed if a directed verdict should have been granted as   to one of the counts submitted to the jury.

The jury   should have the discretion to determine whether the plaintiff has   proven the claim against the separate defendants. Further, the   jury should have the discretion to determine whether to award pu-   nitive damages against only one defendant when separate claims   are alleged against each defendant.      When the plaintiff has alleged separate claims and is seeking   different damages from each of several defendants, the trial court   should include as many separate verdicts on the verdict form as   are necessary to prevent the entry of a verdict or damages against   an incorrect defendant.      In CP & B Enterprises, Inc. v. Mellert, 762 So. 2d 356 (Ala.   2000), plaintiff sued her co-worker for assault and battery and   invasion of privacy. She also claimed her employer was vicariously   liable and for negligent and wanton retention of the co-worker.   The Court held that a special verdict form was required because   the jury should have the discretion to award punitive damages   against one defendant when separate claims are proven against   each defendant. Specifically, the jury should have had the discre-   tion to award punitive damages on the assault claim against the   co-worker and compensatory damages only against the employer   on the negligent retention claim.      If more than one count is submitted to the jury, and the jury   returns a general verdict, the judgment entered upon the verdict   will be reversed if a directed verdict should have been granted as   to one of the counts submitted to the jury.

If more than one count is submitted to the jury, and the jury   returns a general verdict, the judgment entered upon the verdict   will be reversed if a directed verdict should have been granted as   to one of the counts submitted to the jury.

A will may be contested either:      1. In the probate court in which it is offered, before the   probate. Ala. Code § 43-8-190 (1975) (West’s Alabama   Code), or      2. In the circuit court within six months after the will has   been admitted to probate, and the person contesting the      will must not have previously contested it. Ala. Code   § 438-8-199 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). Stevens v.   Gary, 565 So. 2d 73 (Ala. 1990).      But, in Mobile, Jefferson, Shelby, and Pickens Counties   the will may be contested in probate court after it is admit-   ted to probate. The user should read Byrd v. Bentley, 221   So. 3d 1064 (Ala. 2016), Bolin, J., concurring specially, to   determine the circumstances when the contest can be filed   in the probate courts in those counties after the will has   been admitted to probate.      Probate is the “ ‘act or process of proving a will.’ Black’s   Law Dictionary 1365-66 (4th rev. ed. 1968).” Russell v.   Maxwell, 387 So. 2d 156, 157 (Ala. 1980).      The will must be offered for probate before it can be   contested. Hooper v. Huey, 293 Ala. 63, 300 So. 2d 100   (1974), disapproved of in part, Bardin v. Jones, 371 So. 2d 23   (Ala. 1979).      The same person may petition to probate the will and to   contest it. Hooper v. Huey, 293 Ala. 63, 300 So. 2d 100 (1974),   disapproved of in part, Bardin v. Jones, 371 So. 2d 23 (Ala.   1979).      Proceedings under § 43-8-190 or § 43-8-199 must comply   “exactly with the terms” of either statute. Ex parte Floyd,   105 So. 3d 1193, 1197 (Ala. 2012) (quoting Simpson v. Jones,   460 So. 2d 1282, 1284 (Ala. 1984)).      331            Ala. Code § 43-8-5 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) may   toll the time to file a will contest in circuit court, but the   fraud that tolls the time to file must be the kind of fraud   that would allow relief for fraud on the court. Floyd at 1198;   Christian v. Murray, 915 So. 2d 23 (Ala. 2005). Section 43-   8-5 applies “when a contestant. . . shows that the proponent   . . . has engaged in fraud in connection with the administra-   tion of his estate;. . . .” Floyd at 1198.      No will shall be effective unless probated within five   years from the death of the testator unless the testator was   not an inhabitant of this State at his or her death. Ala. Code   § 43-8-161 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      II.   Grounds for Contest      1. The will was not duly executed.     2. The testator or testatrix was of unsound mind.   3. Any other valid objection.     Ala. Code § 43-8-190 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).   Other valid grounds are:      (a) The will was procured by undue influence (confidential   relationship). Ex parte Helms, 873 So. 2d 1139 (Ala.   2003).      (b) The will was executed through mistake. Martindale v.   Bridgforth, 210 Ala. 565, 98 So. 800 (1924).      (c) The will was procured by fraud. Cf. Bolan v. Bolan, 611   So. 2d 1051 (Ala. 1993) (fraud is generally considered a   species of undue influence); Shirley v. Ezell, 180 Ala.   352, 60 So. 905 (1913). Cf., Shipman v. Furniss, 69 Ala.   555, 1881 WL 1198 (1881) (dicta).      (d) The will was revoked by the testator. Maxwell v.   Dawkins, 974 So. 2d 282 (Ala. 2006); Crim v.

Contest in Probate Court      The contest must be filed before the court issues a final   order that the will is valid. Ex parte Barrows, 892 So. 2d 914   (Ala. 2004); Steele v. Sullivan, 484 So. 2d 422 (Ala. 1986). A   contest may be filed by any person interested in the will or   who would be an heir or distributee of the estate if the testa-   tor had died intestate. Ala. Code § 43-8-190 (1975) (West’s   Alabama Code).      The contest is tried on the issues made up under direc-   tion of the court between the applicant who is designated as   plaintiff and the contestant as defendant. Ala. Code § 43-8-   190 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      A contest may be tried by jury in the probate court. Ala.   Code §§ 43-8-190 to 197 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). Furrow   v. Helton, 13 So. 3d 350 (Ala. 2008).      The Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure “are applicable to   [a contest in probate court] to the extent. . . [the] proceed-   ings are not controlled by statute.” Cook v. Cook, 396 So. 2d   1037 (Ala. 1981).      The costs of the will contest “must be paid by the contest-   ing party if he fails.” Ala. Code § 43-8-196 (1975) (West’s Al-   abama Code). The contesting party “fails” if he or she does   not present credible evidence in support of any theory of the   contest. McGee v. McGee, 91 So. 3d 659, 670 (Ala. 2012). In   McGee at n. 17 the Court noted the contestant did not offer   credible evidence of “any” ground of the contest. Attorney’s   fees can be awarded as part of the costs.      A party can appeal the contest verdict to the circuit court   or the Supreme Court of Alabama. Ala. Code § 12-22-21   (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      333            IV.   Transfer of will contest to circuit court.      Burns v. Ashley, 274 So. 3d 970 (Ala. 2018).   Jones v. Brewster, 282 So. 3d 854 (Ala. 2019).      The circuit court has no jurisdiction over a will contest   unless the probate court first opens the estate by acting on      the petition for letters of administration. Ex parte Baker,   183 So. 3d 139 (Ala. 2015).      A will contest may be transferred from the probate court   to circuit court upon written demand of any party, and the   demand must be made at the time the initial pleading is   filed. Ala. Code § 48-8-198 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).   Kaller By and Through Conway v. Rigdon, 480 So. 2d 536   (Ala. 1985).      Only a valid contest proceeding can be transferred to   circuit court. Nottage v. Jones, 388 So. 2d 923 (Ala. 1980). A   valid contest is a contest the probate court has jurisdiction   to hear. Steele v. Sullivan, 484 So. 2d 422 (Ala. 1986).      Upon transfer of the contest to the circuit court the is-   sues must be made up in the circuit court as if the trial were   to be held in the probate court and trial had as in all other   civil cases in the circuit court. Ala. Code § 43-8-198 (1975)   (West’s Alabama Code). But, the contest can be amended in   circuit court to state those issues that can properly be raised   in a will contest. Bardin v. Jones, 371 So. 2d 23 (Ala. 1979).   The contest can be amended to conform to the evidence. Crim   v. Pike, 663 So. 2d 903 (Ala. 1995).      The transfer to circuit court under § 43-8-198 is an      extension of the probate proceedings. Bardin v. Jones, 371   So. 2d 238 (Ala. 1979).      V.   Contest filed in circuit court.      Neither Ala. Code § 43-8-198 (1975) (West’s Alabama   Code) nor § 43-8-190 states who shall be designated as      334      WILL CONTEST      plaintiff and who shall be designated as defendant in a will   contest case in circuit court or probate court.      Our Supreme Court recognized that none of the statutes   state the procedure and it established the procedure as   follows:      (1) The defendant, who is in effect the proponent, should   first introduce the proceedings in the probate court. A   will which has been admitted to probate must be   received in evidence without further proof.      (2) The plaintiff, who is in effect the contestant, then should   introduce evidence on which the alleged invalidity of   the will is based.      (3) The proponent-defendant should then introduce rebut-   tal evidence, if any.      (4) The proponent-defendant should make the opening   arguments to the jury.      (5) The contestant-plaintiff should make the arguments for   contestant.      (6) The proponent-defendant should have the closing   argument.      Smith v. Bryant, 263 Ala. 331, 334, 82 So. 2d 411, 414 (1955).      The words “opening arguments”, refer to argument after   the evidence is in. Cook v. Cook, 396 So. 2d 1037 (Ala. 1981).   In Cook the contestant made what is normally understood as   an opening statement, and the court refused to allow the   proponent to make a rebuttal opening. The Court held the   trail court did not commit error.      The costs of the will contest “must be paid by the contest-   ing party if he fails.” Ala. Code § 43-8-196 (1975) (West's Al-   abama Code). The contesting party “fails” is he or she does   not present credible evidence in support of any theory of the   contest. McGee v. McGee, 91 So. 3d 659, 670 (Ala. 2012). In      335         McGee at n. 17 the Court noted the contestant did not offer   credible evidence of “any” ground of the contest. Attorney’s   fees can be awarded as part of the costs.

(Name(s) of contestant(s)) say(s)   the document is not a valid will because (state the grounds   for contest).      I will refer to the document as a will, but that does not   mean it is a valid will. You must decide whether it is valid.      The law gives every person of sound mind and 18 years   of age or older the right to dispose of (his/her) property at   death by a written document called a will.      A person of sound mind has the legal right to dispose of   (his/her) property any way (he/she) pleases. We are not here   to decide how (name of decedent) should have disposed of   (his/her) property or how you would have disposed of it. We   are not concerned about whether (he/she) acted fairly or   generously or kindly.      We are not here to rewrite (name of decedent)’s will. We   are here to determine the issues raised in this will contest   between the parties.      Approved May 9, 2014      Notes on Use      Will contests are governed by statute, and to the extent they   are not, the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure apply. The statutes   do not provide the order of proceeding in a will contest. The order   was judicially determined in Smith v. Bryant, 263 Ala. 331, 334,   82 So. 2d 411, 414 (1955).      It has been held that it is not error to refuse the proponent an      337            opportunity to respond to the contestant’s opening statement. Cook   v. Cook, 396 So. 2d 1037, 1041 (Ala. 1981). On the other hand, no   case states that the trial judge would abuse his or her discretion to   allow the contestant and the proponent to open. The user may   wish to refer to Ala. R. Evid. 611.

The witnesses to a will can wit-   ness either the decedent’s acknowledgment of his or her signature,   or the will.      The Alabama Uniform Probate Code relaxed some of the      technical requirements for the execution of a will. Pope v. Clark,   551 So. 2d 1053 (Ala. 1989).      According to the commentary to § 43-8-131, it is not necessary   that the will be signed in the witnesses’ presence. However, the   decedent must acknowledge to the witnesses that the document is   his or her will or that the signature is his or her signature. And,   the witnesses do not have to be in each other’s presence when each   witnesses the will. See, Pirtle v. Tucker, 960 So. 2d 620 (Ala. 2006).   The statute does not appear to contemplate that the acknowledg-   ment be formal, i.e., before a notary or some other officer. See,   Burns v. Marshall, 767 So. 2d 347, 351 (Ala. 2000).      References   Ala. Code § 43-8-131 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) states:      Except as provided within section 43-8-135, every will   shall be in writing signed by the testator or in the testator’s   name by some other person in the testator’s presence and by   his direction, and shall be signed by at least two persons each   of whom witnessed either the signing or the testator’s   acknowledgment of the signature or of the will.

But, see below.      The user is advised of a conflict in the case authority whether   the elements listed in this instruction are elements of a prima   facie case or whether they are the elements of the presumption of   undue influence.

The recent cases state the favored beneficiary must use undue   influence over the will-maker; however, older case authority holds   that someone close to the favored beneficiary can use undue influ-   ence to cause the decedent to favor a beneficiary. See, e. g., Rabon   v. Rabon, 360 So. 2d 971 (Ala. 1978); Coghill v.

Approved September 5, 2014      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when the contestant(s) claim an earlier   will was revoked by a later will or because the earlier will was   destroyed. It is patterned on Ala. Code § 43-8-136 (1975) (West’s   Alabama Code).      A will can be partially revoked, and the instruction does not   instruct about the disposition of a gift when a will is partially   revoked. The disposition of a revoked gift is controlled by whether   the gift was material to the overall testamentary plan which   includes consideration of whether it was an individual or class gift.      When the contestant claims a later will revoked an earlier will   or revoked or changed a bequest or devise, the contestant becomes   the proponent of the later will and the contestant must prove it is   valid. Additionally, the proponent of the earlier will may contest   the later will. A codicil cannot revoke an earlier will. See, Hansel   v. Head, 706 So. 2d 1142 (Ala. 1997) (action to construe a will).      A testator or testatrix cannot partially revoke a will by physi-   cal act. The Supreme Court of Alabama wrote to attempted partial      revocation by physical act in, among other cases, Hansel, and Law   v. Law, 83 Ala. 432, 3 So. 752 (1888).      The testator in Law just lined through a legacy’s name and   there was evidence that he intended that the act revoke his will.   In this situation the jury or fact finder must determine whether   the will-maker intended the act to revoke the will. If the jury or   fact finder determines that the will-maker did not intend to revoke   the will, the will is probated as originally written and executed.      The joint will-makers in Hansel obliterated a legacy and the   trial judge could not determine the legacy. Neither the proponent      358      WILL CONTEST      nor the contestants offered any evidence about what the will-   makers intended when they obliterated the legacy. In this situa-   tion the share allocable to the person whose name was obliterated   passes through intestacy unless the legacy was material to the   overall testamentary plan. Included within this consideration is   the issue whether the gift was an individual or a class gift. This   caveat may apply to the circumstances presented in Law v. Law.      Ala. Code § 43-8-138 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) governs   tS Poe aane or revival of an earlier will that is revoked by a   ater will.      References   Ala. Code § 43-8-136 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) states:      (a) A will or any part thereof is revoked by a subsequent   will which revokes the prior will or part expressly or by   inconsistency.      (b) A will is revoked by being burned, torn, canceled, oblit-   erated, or destroyed, with the intent and for the purpose of   revoking it by the testator or by another person in his pres-   ence by his consent and direction. If the physical act is by   someone other than the testator, consent and direction of the   testator must be proved by at least two witnesses.      Ala. Code § 43-8-138 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) states:      (a) If a second will which, had it remained effective at   death, would have revoked the first will in whole or in part, is   thereafter revoked by acts under section 43-8-136, the first   will is revoked in whole or in part unless it is evident from the   circumstances of the revocation of the second will or from   testator’s contemporary or subsequent declarations in writing,   signed by the testator and attested as prescribed in section 48-   8-131, that he intended the first will to take effect as executed.      (b) If a second will which, had it remained effective at death,   would have revoked the first will in whole or in part, is there-   after revoked by a third will, the first will is revoked in whole   or in part, except to the extent it appears from the terms of   the third will that the testator intended the first will to take   effect.

Compensatory damages are awarded to fairly and rea-   sonably compensate (name of plaintiff) for the harm, if any,   caused by (name of defendant)’s conduct.      The measure of compensatory damages is the sum of:      1. The property’s fair market value on the date it was   converted or its fair market value at any time after it was   converted to (date the trial started), whichever is higher;   and,      2. Interest from the date the property was converted at   six percent a year until your verdict.      Approved October 6, 2017      Notes on Use      This instruction states the general rule of damages, and it as-   sumes the property was free of debt.      When an indebtedness is owed, the measure of damages is the   difference between the property’s reasonable market value at the   time it is converted and the balance due on the debt, plus interest.   Simmons Mach. Co., Inc. v. M & M Brokerage, Inc., 409 So. 2d 743   (Ala. 1981).      The property’s value is market value at the place it was   converted, and if there is no market at that place, then its value at   the nearest market. Zimmern v. Southern Ry.

An account is a general term. It covers any money owed   as the result of an express or implied contract between (name   of plaintiff) and (name of defendant).      To recover, (name of plaintiff) must reasonably satisfy   you from the evidence:      1. That (name of defendant) owes (name of plaintiff)   the amount or any part of the amount of money (he/she/it)   claims; and,      2. The amount of money is due.      If (name of plaintiff) proved both these things, you must   find for (him/her/it), and then you must determine an amount   of money to award (name of plaintiff).      If (name of plaintiff) did not prove these things, you   must find for (name of defendant).      Approved March 8, 2019      Notes on Use      Car Center, Inc. v. Home Indem.

That the money rightfully belongs to (name of   plaintiff).      If (name of plaintiff) proved these things, you must find   for (name of plaintiff). Then you must determine an amount   of money to award (name of plaintiff).      If (name of plaintiff) did not prove these things, you   must find for (name of defendant).

(Name of plaintiff) further says (he/she) sought workers’   compensation benefits for the injury and that (name of   defendant) fired (him/her) solely because (he/she) sought   these benefits.      (Name of defendant) denies (name of plaintiff)’s claim,   and further says (e.g. (name of plaintiff) was not fired from   (his/her) job but either voluntarily quit or abandoned (his/   her) job; (name of plaintiff) was fired but (he/she) never   sought workers’ compensation benefits; (name of plaintiff)   was not fired because (he/she) sought workers’ compensation   benefits; (name of plaintiff) was fired because (specify the   reason(s) defendant says plaintiff was legitimately fired);   etc.).      Alabama is an employee at will state. This means that,   in this case, (name of plaintiff) can be fired for a good rea-   son, a bad reason, or no reason, with this exception: if (he/   she) had an on-the-job injury and sought workers’ compensa-   tion benefits for that injury, (he/she) cannot be fired solely   because (he/she) sought those benefits.      To recover damages on this claim, (name of plaintiff)   must prove to your reasonable satisfaction all the following:      (1) That (he/she) was an employee of (name of defendant)   and had an on-the-job injury;      (2) That before (he/she) was fired (he/she) sought workers’   compensation benefits for an on-the-job injury;      (3) That (name of the person who fired plaintiff / the   person(s) who made the decision to fire plaintiff) knew   (name of plaintiff) sought workers’ compensation   benefits for the injury; and,      421            (4) That (name of defendant) fired (name of plaintiff) solely   because (he/she) sought workers’ compensation benefits.      If (name of plaintiff) proves all these things, you must   find for (him/her) and then you must determine what amount   of money to award (him/her) for the harm. If (name of   plaintiff) does not prove all these things, you will find for   (name of defendant).

If (name of plaintiff) proves all these things, you must   find for (him/her) and then you must determine what amount   of money to award (him/her) for the harm. If (name of   plaintiff) does not prove all these things, you will find for   (name of defendant).      Circumstantial Evidence of Causation?      When deciding if (name of plaintiff) was fired solely   because (he/she) sought workers’ compensation benefits, you   may consider any evidence about:      1. (The closeness in time between (his/her) claim for   benefits and when (he/she) was fired.)      2.

Approved September 7, 2012      Notes on Use   The instruction replaces (2011 Cum. Supp.).      The elements of an action that an employer fired an employee   solely because the employee filed a notice of violation of a safety   rule have not been decided by any Alabama appellate court. 1985   Ala. Acts 41 created the cause of action and a substantial body of   law defines the elements of a prima facie case for retaliatory dis-   charge because the employee sought workers’ compensation   benefits. Therefore, the Committee believes it reasonable that this   instruction should parallel.      The Committee omitted any reference to shifting burdens of   going forward with the evidence. This is a matter for the trial   judge when determining whether the employer is due judgment as   a matter of law. The instruction is drafted to cover most of the is-   sues that will arise in the trial of a retaliatory discharge claim.      “An employee is ‘terminated’ if he or she is either fired or   ‘constructively discharged’.” Ex parte Breitsprecher, 772 So. 2d   1125, 1129, 16 I.E.R. Cas. (BNA) 557 (Ala. 2000) (quoting Twilley   v. Daubert Coated Products, Inc., 536 So. 2d 1364, 4 I.E.R. Cas.   (BNA) 731 (Ala. 1988)).      Constructive discharge is defined in Irons v. Service   Merchandise Co., Inc., 611 So. 2d 294, 295 (Ala. 1992), as follows:      [I]f the employer deliberately makes an employee’s working   conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into invol-   untary resignation, then the employer has [brought about] a   constructive discharge and is liable for any illegal conduct   involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved   employee (quoting Jurgens v. EEOC, 903 F. 2d 386, 390 (5th   Cir. 1990)).      Caveat—Is Written Notice of a safety rule violation required?      Whether the employee must file a “written” notice of violation   with the employer is an undecided question. The issue was raised      430      WORKERS’ COMPENSATION      but not decided in Morgan v. Northeast Alabama Regional Medical   Center, 624 So. 2d 560, 563, 8 I.E.R. Cas. (BNA) 1365 (Ala. 1993).   The Morgan court stated:      We need not decide whether a written complaint is necessary,   or whether clear evidence of specific, pertinent oral complaints   will suffice, because Morgan’s written complaint to OSHA   prompted OSHA to investigate NEARMC’s facilities. OSHA   provided NEARMC with a copy of the formal complaint, al-   though it appears that OSHA may not have informed NE-   ARMC of who filed the complaint. The complaint that was   submitted to NEARMC, together with the evidence of repeated   oral complaints by Morgan, is sufficient evidence of notice to   the defendants for Morgan to invoke the protection of § 25-5-   Leh:      Because § 25-5-11.1 states the notice must be written, the   Committee drafted the instruction in accordance with that   language.      Caveat—Must the reporting employee incur an injury that   results in death or permanent disability?      No Alabama decision addresses this issue; however, the United   States District Court answered the question affirmatively in Phillips   v. General Elec. Co., 881 F. Supp. 1553 (M.D. Ala. 1995). The hold-   ing is questioned in 2 Terry A. Moore, Alabama Workers’   Compensation Law §§ 20:32 n. 30 (1998); in 1 Michael G. Roberts   & Gregory S. Cusimano, Alabama Tort Law § 16.06 p. 728 (5th ed.   2010); and in Robert C. Lockwood, Alabama’s Statutory Exception   to the Employee-At-Will Doctrine: Retaliatory Discharge Claims   Under Alabama Code Section 25-5-11.1, 47 Ala. L. Rev. 541, 554   (Winter 1996).      Morgan held § 25-5-11.1 does not incorporate “all the strict   requirements of § 25-5-11(c)(4). Therefore, at this time the Com-   mittee believes Morgan controls this issue and the instruction does   not require that the plaintiff incur an injury that results in death   or permanent injury. However, the user is encouraged to research   this issue in the event an Alabama appellate court holds in accor-   dance with Phillips.      References   Ala.

(Name of plaintiff/name of deceased) was intoxicated if   (he/she) did not have the normal use of (his/her) mental fac-   ulties, and as a result (he/she) was not capable of acting in a   way an ordinary prudent and cautious person, in full posses-   sion of (his/her) faculties, using reasonable care, would act in   the same situation.      Notes on Use      An employee’s intoxication is an affirmative defense to his or   her workers’ compensation claim if the intoxication caused the em-   ployee’s injury or death. Ala. Code § 25-5-51 (1975) (West’s Ala-   bama Code). Either the employee or the employer can ask for a   jury trial on this one issue. Ala. Code § 25-5-81(a)(2) (1975) (West’s   Alabama Code).      The definition of intoxication is the definition in.      See, Causation defined.      The fact that the employee’s intoxication may have contributed   to the injury or death is not a defense; the employee’s intoxication   must be the cause of the injury or death. Ala.

If (name of defendant) proves to your reasonable satis-   faction from the evidence that: (1) (name of plaintiff) was   impaired by illegal drugs when (he/she) was (harmed/killed);   and (2) that the impairment was a cause of (his/her) (harm/   death), you will find for (name of defendant). If (name of   defendant) does not prove both of these, you will find for   (name of plaintiff).      (Name of plaintiff/name of deceased) was impaired by il-   legal drugs if (he/she) was under the influence of illegal   drugs.      Revised April 11, 2014      Notes on use      An employee’s impairment by illegal drugs is an affirmative   defense to his or her workers’ compensation claim if the impair-   ment caused the employee’s injury or death. Ala. Code § 25-5-51   (1975) (West’s Alabama Code); Ross v. Ellard Const. Co., Inc., 686   So. 2d 1190 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996). Either the employee or the   employer can ask for a jury trial on this one issue. Section 25-5-81      (a). (2),      “A positive drug test conducted and evaluated pursuant to   standards adopted for drug testing by the U.S. Department of   Transportation in C. F. R. Part 40 shall be a conclusive presump-   tion of impairment resulting from the use of illegal drugs.” Ala.   Code § 25-5-51 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). Whether the drug   test met the standards can be a jury issue and the trial judge must   instruct the jury on this issue. The user should be aware that 49   C.F.R. Part 40 is an extensive list of administrative regulations   (49 C.F.R. 40.1 to 40.413 with appendices). The Committee sug-      447            gests the trial judge may instruct, as follows: If you are reasonably   satisfied from the evidence that (name of plaintiff)’s positive drug   test for (name the drug) was conducted and evaluated according to   the United States Department of Transportation standards for   drug testing, you must find that (he/she) was impaired.      Ala. Code § 25-5-51 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code) does not   define “being impaired by illegal drugs”. The Alabama Court of   Civil Appeals stated, “‘impairment’. . . clearly means that the   worker is under the influence of illegal drugs.” Ross v. Ellard   Const. Co., Inc., 686 So. 2d 1190, 1193 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996). The   instruction does not define “under the influence of illegal drugs.”   The Committee will await a clear definition by the legislature or   the appellate courts.      The fact that the employee’s impairment may have contributed   to the injury or death is not a defense; the employee’s impairment   must be the cause of the injury or death.      References   Ala.

Before (name of plaintiff) can recover for conspiracy, you   must find against at least one of the defendants on (name of   plaintiff)’s claim for (state the underlying tort(s)).      If you do not find against at least one of the defendants,   (name of plaintiff) cannot recover on (his/her/its) claim that   the defendants conspired to (state the underlying tort). In   this event, you must find for (names of defendants) on the   conspiracy claim.      If you find against one of the defendants on the claim   for (state the underlying tort), to recover for conspiracy   (name of plaintiff) must reasonably satisfy you from the   evidence:      1. That any two defendants agreed and worked to-   gether to commit (state the underlying tort);      2. That they did so to harm (name of plaintiff);      3. That one or more defendants did some overt act to   achieve (state the underlying tort); and,      4. That (name of defendant)’s conduct caused (name of   plaintiff) harm.      If (name of plaintiff) proved all these things, you will   find for (him/her/it) and against any defendant who, you   find, was part of the conspiracy. You must then determine   the amount of damages to award (name of plaintiff).      461            Approved November 10, 2017      Notes on Use   This instruction is new.      If the trial judge has instructed the jury about the plaintiffs   contentions about the underlying tort, it is not necessary to do so   again. If the trial judge has not done so, then he or she should   summarize the plaintiffs factual theory about the conspiracy claim.      Element number 3 must be modified if a co-conspirator is not   a defendant.      An overt act is any act done to further the object of the   conspiracy. For example, the overt act in Singleton v. Protective   Life Ins. Co., 857 So. 2d 803, 806 (Ala. 2003) was the claimed false   representation that the credit life insurance was sold in an amount   that would pay off the loans in the event of the plaintiffs death.      The overt act done in furtherance of a civil conspiracy “need   not be the sole proximate cause of [plaintiff's harm], but must be   at least a concurring proximate cause.” Jenelle Mims Marsh, Ala-   bama Law of Damages § 36:24 (6th ed. 2012).

A trade secret is information the law protects, and it can   take many forms.      (Name of plaintiff) says (name of defendant) disclosed or   used (plaintiff)’s trade secret without the right to do so.   (Name of plaintiff) says (state how plaintiff says the infor-   mation was disclosed and by whom, how it was used, and   what were the improper means).      To recover (name of plaintiff) must prove to your reason-   able satisfaction from the evidence that:      1. (Describe the information) is a trade secret; and,   2. (Name of defendant) misappropriated it.     (Name of defendant) says:     (The (describe the information) is not a trade secret).   (He/she/it) did not misappropriate it because:      (a. (He/she/it) reverse engineered the product and   discovered the information (name of plaintiff) says is a   trade secret.)      (b. (Name of plaintiff) abandoned the trade secret   by (describe the act of abandonment.)      (c. (Name of plaintiff) waited too long to file this   lawsuit and cannot recover.)      (d. (Name of plaintiff) gave (name of defendant)   consent to use the trade secret.)      465            (e. (Name of plaintiff) gave (name of defendant)   partial consent to use the trade secret.)      (f. (He/she/it) innocently got the trade secret from   (identify the individual or entity) and did not misuse it.)      Approved June 10, 2016      Notes on Use      The instructions in this chapter are new and based on the AI-   abama Trade Secrets Act, 1987 Ala. Acts 669 as amended by 2010   Ala. Acts 449, Ala. Code §§ 8-27-1 to 6 (1975) (West’s Alabama   Code). Alabama Law Institute committee comments follow most   code sections, but “although [the comments] are useful in construc-   tion, [they] have not been enacted by the legislature and do not   necessarily represent legislative intent.” IMED Corp. v. Systems   Engineering Associates Corp., 602 So. 2d 344, 348 (Ala. 1992). The   user should consider the comments against the clear language of   the act. Id.      The act’s purpose is “to protect individual property rights in   trade secrets and, thereby, to foster the development of new   products and technology in [Alabama].” Id. at 347. The act   supersedes Alabama common law inconsistent with the act,   otherwise it should be construed as consistent with the common   law of trade secrets. Section 8-27-6. The Alabama Law Institute   committee’s position is “the Act should supersede the common law   when it deals with reasonable clarity with a particular point, but   that the common law should be used to ‘round out’ the interpreta-   tion of the Act with respect to matters not otherwise clearly covered   by the Act.” Thad G. Long, The Alabama Trade Secrets Act, 18   Cumb. L. Rev. 557, 562 (1987-1988).      The instructions assume the plaintiffs claim is not preempted   by federal law, e. g., the 1976 Copyright Act or federal patent law.   Drill Parts & Service Co., Inc. v. Joy Mfg. Co., 489 So. 2d 43 (Ala.   1983), superseded by the Alabama Trade Secrets Act, Allied Supply   Co., Inc. v. Brown, 585 So. 2d 33 (Ala. 1991), predates the Act. The   Court held neither federal copyright law nor federal patent law   preempted Alabama’s common law of trade secrets. See, 2 Louis   Altman & Malla Pollack, Callmann on Unfair Competition,   Trademarks & Monopolies § 14:2 (4th ed. June 2016). Although it   does not pertain to these instructions, the user may wish to become      466      TRADE SECRETS      familiar with the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 U.S.C.   § 1836(b).      A tradesecret is information the law protects. It can be posi-   tive information, i. e., information about what works, or it can be   negative information, i. e., information about what does not work   or will not work. Ala. Code § 8-27-2 cmt. (a)(1) (1975) (West’s Ala-   bama Code).      The Alabama Trade Secrets Act protects “the trade secrets of   another” from misappropriation. It states a “person” who discloses   or uses the trade secret of another is liable to the other for   misappropriation. Section 8-27-2(3) defines “person.”, but the act   does not explicitly state that the other person must be the “owner”   of the trade secret.      The word “owner” is used in one subsection. Section 8-27-2(2)   states:      Improper means. Improper means are means such as:      7 cK OOK CK      f. Other deliberate acts taken for the specific purpose of gain-   ing access to the information of another by means suchas. . .   where the trade secret owner reasonably should be able to   expect privacy.      The comments do use the word “owner” three times. See, e.g.,   8-27-2 cmt. and cmt. b. But the comment to 8-27-4, Remedies,   speaks of “the possessor of the trade secret”, and “the trade secret   owner.”      Our appellate courts have not had occasion to determine   whether ownership, as opposed to possession, is necessary to bring   an action for misappropriation. The Supreme Court of Alabama   has determined a corporation can have a property interest in a   computer software program. National Surety Corp. v. Applied   Systems, Inc., 418 So. 2d 847 (Ala. 1982). National Surety predates   the ATSA, but the act does not suggest this holding is no longer   good law. The right to use information can be assigned or licensed.      Various cases and commentators discuss the nature of the   property interest. See, e.g., DTM Research, L.L.C. v. AT&T Corp.,   245 F.3d 327, 58 U.S.P.Q.2d 1236 (4th Cir. 2001) (fee simple prop-      467            erty interest analysis inappropriate), 2 Louis Altman & Malla   Pollack, Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks & Monopo-   hes §§ 14:3, 14:17, 14:36 (4th ed.

(Name of plaintiff) must prove misappropriation to your rea-   sonable satisfaction from the evidence.      A person who discloses or uses the trade secret of an-   other, without a right or privilege to do so, is liable for mis-   appropriation of the trade secret if:      1. The person using the trade secret discovered the trade   secret by improper means;      2. That disclosure or use of the trade secret was a breach of   confidence by the person using the trade secret;      3. The person using the trade secret learned the trade se-   cret from a third person, and knew or should have known   that (i) the information was a trade secret, and (11) that   the trade secret had been appropriated by improper   means or a breach of confidence; or      4. The person using the trade secret knew or should have   known that it was a trade secret and that its disclosure   had been made by mistake.      Approved June 10, 2016      Notes on Use      It is sufficient for a trade secret claimant to prove just one of   the means of “misappropriation” listed above.      This instruction states only the substance of the elements of   misappropriation. The plaintiff may sue both the misappropriator,   e.g., the plaintiffs employee or former employee, and the user, e.g.,   the new employer, or the misappropriator and the user can be one   and the same. Therefore, the trial judge must alter the instruction   to fit the facts of the case.      482      TRADE SECRETS      The trial judge must define breach of confidence. A breach of   confidence can occur when an agent, servant, or employee violates   his or her fiduciary duty to the principal or employer. See, e.g.,   Allied Supply Co., Inc. v. Brown, 585 So. 2d 33 (Ala. 1991) (at-will   employees planning to form a new company solicited Allied’s   customers). Or, it can occur if an employee violates a non-compete   or confidentiality agreement. See, e.g., Ex parte W.L. Halsey   Grocery Co., 897 So. 2d 1028 (Ala. 2004) (non-compete agreement);   Systrends, Inc. v. Group 8760, LLC, 959 So. 2d 1052 (Ala. 2006)   (non-compete and confidentiality agreement). This list of examples   is non-exclusive.

(Name of defendant)   says (state how defendant says he/she/it got express consent).      A party gives express consent when (he/she/it) directly,   clearly, and unmistakably gives permission to another to use   the trade secret. Express consent can be written or oral.

Approved Sept. 9, 2016      Notes on Use      The Alabama appellate courts have not decided a case where   the defendant raised consent by the trade secret holder. This   instruction is based on commentary from the Uniform Trade   Secrets Act (1979) and Restatement (First) of Torts § 757 (1939).   The definition of express consent is drawn from Black’s Law Dictio-   nary p. 300 (7th ed. 1999). The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals   defined “express consent” from Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed.   1968) in another context in Personnel Bd. For Mobile County v.   Bronstein, 354 So. 2d 8, 10 (Ala. Civ. App. 1977).      If defendant argues plaintiffs consent is implied, use APJI 44.   16.      If the jury must determine whether the information is a trade   secret, use the word “information”. If not, use the words “trade   secret”.      The instruction is a statement of consent as defensive matter.   When the trial judge must instruct the jury on the law of principal   and agent, the instructions in Alabama Pattern Jury Instruc-   tions—Civil (8rd ed. 2015) chapter three, will assist the user.      487            References      Ala.

Reverse engineering is a   process of starting with a product and working backward to   figure out how it was developed or manufactured.      A person has the right to take apart or study products   that (he/she/it) acquires by proper means. For example, a   person acquires a product by proper means if he or she buys   it in the marketplace.      To prove this defense, (name of defendant) must reason-   ably satisfy you from the evidence that:      1. (He/she/it) acquired the (specify the product) by   proper means; and,      2. (He/she/it) reverse engineered it without help from   another person who had access to the trade secret.

Co., 439 So. 2d 43,   50 (Ala. 1983) first recognized trade secrets in Alabama, and the   Court noted that reverse engineering was not misappropriation.   Drill Parts is superseded by the Alabama Trade Secrets Act, Allied   Supply Co., Inc. v. Brown, 585 So. 2d 33 (Ala. 1991), but reverse   engineering is a recognized defense to an action for   misappropriation.      Reverse engineering must be done independently. See, Re-   statement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 43 (West, Mar. 2016)   (not adopted in Alabama). If done with someone with knowledge of   the plaintiffs trade secret, it is tainted and cannot be relied on as      491            a defense. 2 Louis Altman & Malla Pollack, Callmann on Unfair   Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies § 14:28 n. 3.70 (4th ed.

If actual   damages do not cover all the profits of the misappropriator that   are attributable to the misappropriation, then, to the extent they   are not covered, such profits also may be awarded, and, if profits of   the misappropriator do not cover all the damage caused to the   trade secret owner, then, to the extent they are not covered, dam-   ages may be awarded in addition to profits.

The defendant may be liable for misappropriation of a trade   secret even if the defendant modifies or improves the trade secret.   As long as the trade secret’s information or process still is   substantially the same, the jury must find the defendant liable for   misappropriation (regardless of differences in detail). However, the   jury may consider such differences when it calculates the amount   of damages that the plaintiff should be awarded, and the jury is   free to diminish that amount to account for the defendant’s   modification of, improvement of, or contribution to the trade secret.   See Restatement (First) of Torts § 757 cmt. (c) (1939). It states:   “Differences in detail do not preclude liability if, substantially, the   process used by the actor is derived from the other’s secret in the   manner stated in this Section. The liability is avoided only when   the contribution by the other’s secret is so slight that the actor’s   process can be said to be derived from other sources; although   even in such a case the actor is still subject to liability for harm   caused by his disclosure or possession of the secret, under the   rules stated in $$ 757-759. The extent of the modifications or   improvements made by the actor upon the other’s secret may,   however, affect the computation of damages or profits for which he   is liable to the other.”      497         References   Alabama Code § 8-27-4(a)(1)(b) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).

(“[E]xemplary dam-   ages are permitted in exceptional cases, even if only nominal actual   damages are awarded, in order to discourage trade secret   misappropriation. A maximum level of exemplary damages is   provided in recognition of the facts that (1) competition requires   businesses to obtain trade secrets by lawful means, e.g., reverse   engineering, and that (2) there is a strong public policy against   discouraging businesses from hiring people who formerly have   worked for competitors. These practices can, in practice, approach   impermissible trade secret misappropriation. A minimum exem-   plary damage amount is provided in order to avoid limiting such   damages to nominal amounts in cases in which there is no actual   damage or enrichment.”      Exemplary damages in a trade secrets case carry the same ev-   identiary standard as set forth in.

CODE   § 6-5-70 (1975) (WEST’S ALABAMA   CODE) [PL]      A person who unlawfully sells or furnishes spirituous l-   quors to a minor and knows or should know that the sale or   furnishing is to a minor, may be punished by punitive   damages. A minor is any person under twenty-one.      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) says defendant (name of   defendant) (sold/furnished) (type of spirituous liquor) to   (name of minor). (Name of plaintiff) says (state the circum-   stances about the sale or furnishing liquor to the minor).      ((Name of defendant) says (he/she/it) did everything   required by law to determine that (name of minor) was   twenty-one or older. (He/she/it) says (state what defendant   did under the law and ABC regulations to determine the   minor’s age).)      To recover, (name of plaintiff) must prove to your rea-   sonable satisfaction from the evidence:      1. That (name of defendant) (sold/furnished) spirituous   liquor to (name of minor); and,      (Furnished)      (Name of person) furnished spirituous liquor to (name of   minor) if, from the totality of the circumstances, (he/she)   must have reasonably inferred that (name of person) would   let (name of minor) drink some of the liquor.      2. That (name of defendant) knew or should have   known that (name of minor) was under twenty one.      If (name of plaintiff) proved (name of defendant) knew   (name of minor) was under twenty-one, you will find for (him/   her) and award (name of plaintiff) punitive damages.     If you find that (name of defendant) (sold/furnished)      902      LIQUOR LAWS      spirituous liquor to (name of minor), and you find that (name   of defendant) should have known of (name of minor)’s minor-   ity, then (name of defendant) must prove to your reasonable   satisfaction from the evidence:      1. That (he/she/it) required (name of minor) to give   proof of (his/her) age; and,      2. That (name of minor) presented what reasonably ap-   peared to be:      (A valid driver’s license of any state)      (A valid United States Uniformed Service identifica-   tion)      (A valid passport)      (A valid identification card issued by any agency of   a state for the purpose of identification, bearing a   photograph and date of birth of the individual in ques-   tion)      That showed (name of minor) was twenty-one or older.      If (name of defendant) proved this, you must find for   (name of defendant). If (name of defendant) did not prove   this, you must find for (name of plaintiff) and award (him/   her) punitive damages.      When determining the amount of your punitive dam-   ages award, you may consider all the circumstances that   surrounded the (sale(s)/furnishing). (You may consider the   minor’s conduct and any harm that happened to (him/her)   after the (sale(s)/furnishing)).      Approved October 6, 2017      Notes on Use   The Civil Damages Act is a penal and a strict liability act. The   503            plaintiff can recover only punitive damages. Brackett v. Exit Inn,   Inc., 604 So. 2d 402 (Ala. 1992). The first paragraph of 1 APJI   11.03 defines punitive damages.      The words “spirituous liquors” means distilled liquors and   beer. Espey v. Convenience Marketers, Inc., 578 So. 2d 1221, 1231   (Ala. 1991); McLeod v. Cannon Oil Corp., 603 So. 2d 889, 891 (Ala.   1992). Wine is a spirituous liquor. McLeod (dictum). Laymon v.   Braddock, 544 So. 2d 900 (Ala. 1989) (per curium) assumed the   wine cooler was a spirituous liquor but held the seller did not   furnish the wine cooler to the minor. Justice Houston concurred   and wrote there was no evidence the “California wine coolers” was   spirituous liquor.      The instruction on “furnished” involves three persons. The   first person listed is the person who sold or furnished liquor to the   person who shared it with the minor. The second person listed is   the minor, and the third is the person who permitted the minor to   drink some of the liquor.      1 APJI<p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 27.00'> 27.00</a> (100%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 28.01'> 28.01</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 31.12'> 31.12</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 31.11'> 31.11</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 27.01'> 27.01</a> (99%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 15.01' href='# 15.01'></a> 15.01</h4><p> defines “inference”.

CODE § 6-   5-71 (1975) (WEST’S ALABAMA   CODE) [PL]      Plaintiff (name of plaintiff) filed this lawsuit against   defendant (name of defendant) under what is known as the   Alabama Dram Shop Act.      The Dram Shop Act allows a lawsuit by a person who is   injured by an intoxicated person. The lawsuit is filed against   the person or entity that provided the other person with   alcoholic beverages and caused that person to become   intoxicated (or contributed to his or her intoxication).      (Name of plaintiff) says (name of defendant) furnished   (state the circumstances, i. e., sale/gave/otherwise disposed   of) alcoholic beverages to (name the person). (Name of   plaintiff) further says furnishing the alcoholic beverages   (caused (name) to become intoxicated) (contributed to   (name)’s intoxication).      (Name of plaintiff) says furnishing the alcoholic bever-   ages to (name) was contrary to law because (state the viola-   tion plaintiff claims). And (name of plaintiff) says (describe   (name)’s intoxicated conduct).      Finally, (name of plaintiff) says (he/she/name) was   harmed as a consequence of (name)’s intoxicated conduct.   (State how plaintiff claims (he/she/others) (was/were) harmed   in person, property, or means of support).      (Name of defendant) says (state his/her/its) response.   (Assumption of the risk.)      (Name of defendant) also says (name of plaintiff) cannot   recover because (he/she/name of decedent) voluntarily as-   sumed the risk that (he/she) would be harmed. State the cir-   cumstances (name of defendant) claims support this defense.      This is an affirmative defense, and (name of defendant)      506      LIQUOR LAWS      must prove it to your reasonable satisfaction from the   evidence.      To recover, (name of plaintiff) must prove to your rea-   sonable satisfaction from the evidence:      1. That (name of defendant) furnished alcoholic bever-   ages to (name);      2. That the alcoholic beverages (caused (name) to   become intoxicated) (contributed to (name)’s intoxication);      3. That furnishing the alcoholic beverages to (name)   was contrary to (specify the statute or regulation or both);   and,      4. That as a consequence of (name)’s intoxicated   conduct (name of plaintiff/ name(s) of minor dependent(s))   (was/were) harmed.      If (name of plaintiff) proves all these things, you must   find for (him/her), and then you must determine the amount   of money that will reasonably compensate (name of plaintiff/   (name(s) of minor dependents). If (name of plaintiff) did not   prove all these things, you must find for (name of defendant).      Affirmative defense pleaded.      If (name of plaintiff) proved all these things but (name   of defendant) proved (name of plaintiff/name of decedent)   voluntarily assumed the risk of harm, you must find for   (name of defendant).      Approved May 5, 2017      Notes on Use      The Dram Shop Act provides the exclusive remedy for the   unlawful dispensing of alcohol to an adult. Johnson v. Brunswick   Riverview Club, Inc., 39 So. 3d 132, 139 (Ala. 2009). Johnson also   held, in accordance with precedent, that the Act is penal in nature,      507            but when determining the issue presented, it stated “penal statutes   are to be strictly construed in favor of the persons sought to be   subjected to their operation.” Id. at 138.      The plaintiff is not required to prove that the sale, gift or   other disposition caused his or her injury or damage. The Act   requires only that he or she was damaged as a consequence of the   intoxication resulting from the sale or disposition.

The Department asks you to declare (name) is   an adult in need of protective services.      (Name) says (he/she) is not an adult in need of protec-   tive services.      The Department must reasonably satisfy you from the   evidence:      1. That (name) is 18 years of age or older;      2. That (name)’s behavior indicates that (he/she) is   mentally incapable of adequately caring for (himself/herself)   without serious consequences to (himself/herself) or others;      3. That (name), because of a (physical/mental) impair-   ment, is unable to protect (himself/herself) from (abuse/   neglect/exploitation/sexual abuse/emotional abuse) from oth-   ers; and,      4. That (name) does not have a (guardian/relative/other   appropriate person) who is ready, willing, and available to   assume the kind and degree of protection for (name) required   under the circumstances.      If the Department proves these things, you will find that   (name) is an adult in need of protective services.      If the Department does not prove these things, you must   find (name) is not an adult in need of protective services.      Approved May 11, 2018      Notes on Use      An interested person may file an action to declare an adult in      514      MENTAL HEALTH      need of protective services, and the definition includes “any official   or representative of a public or private agency, . . .” Ala. Code   § 38-9-2(10) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code). The user must amend   the instruction when some interested person other than a county   department of human resources files the action.     This instruction differs from in two significant   respects. First, it does not tell the jury that the adult’s lawyer is   an appointed guardian ad litem. Second, it requires that the   interested person must prove the element stated in Ala. Code § 39-   9-6(a) because only this sub-section authorizes the circuit court to   order protective services or protective placement.     The forms of the verdict are:      We, the Jury, find that (name) is an adult in need of protective   services.      We, the Jury, find that (name) is not an adult in need of protective   services.      Section 38-9-2 states the necessary definitions.   References   Ala.

Plaintiff claims   that the bank’s refusal to pay his check caused him damage   in that (specify); defendant bank claims it was justified in   refusing to pay the check.      Defendant bank had the duty to pay plaintiffs check un-   less ([specify basis of claimed justification, as: _______] the   funds in the account were not sufficient to cover the check,   the check was not properly endorsed in that [specify], or the   check was presented more than six months after its date). If   you are reasonably satisfied from the evidence that (choose a   relevant phrase: [there were sufficient funds in plaintiff's ac-   count, the check was properly endorsed, the check was pre-   sented on or before [date]) and you are further reasonably   satisfied from the evidence that defendant’s refusal to pay   the check was the proximate cause of damage to plaintiff,   you will return a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of dam-   age so caused. If you find that (choose a relevant phrase: the   funds in plaintiffs account were not sufficient to cover the   check, that check was not properly endorsed, the check was   presented on or after the [state date]), or you find that   plaintiff suffered no damage as a result of defendant’s refusal   to pay, your verdict will be in favor of defendant bank.

It is undisputed (The parties agree) that plaintiff had a   checking account with defendant bank and that on (date) he   issued a check payable to the order of AB in the amount of   $__. Plaintiff claims that on (date) he ordered defendant   to stop payment on the check, that contrary to that order   defendant paid the check when presented, and that he was   damaged in that (specify). Defendant denies that the stop   payment order (choose appropriate phrase (was received,   was in sufficient form, or was received in time)).      The stop payment order would be sufficient and timely if   it described the check with sufficient accuracy to enable   defendant to act and if it was received by defendant at a   time and in such manner as to give defendant a reasonable   opportunity to act on it prior to payment of the check. If you   find that (no stop payment order was given, the stop pay-   ment order given was not sufficient in form, or was not   timely), your verdict will be for defendant. If you are reason-   ably satisfied from the evidence that a sufficient stop pay-   ment order was given and that it was timely received and   that contrary to such order defendant paid the check, your   verdict will be for plaintiff in such amount as you are rea-   sonably satisfied from the evidence to be the amount of dam-   ages which proximately resulted to the plaintiff as a result   of defendant’s payment of the check.      Notes on Use      A special charge must be given where the stop payment order   misstates the amount of the check, or the check number, and this   misstatement causes the bank to pay the check. The substance of   that charge will depend in part of the information contained in the   stop-payment form which the plaintiff signed and on the type of   check processing equipment used by the defendant.      524      UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE   References   Ala.

Ordinarily a bank’s arrangement with its customer only   authorizes the bank to pay checks as actually drawn and   signed by its customer. If the bank pays a (forged, altered)   check, it may not ordinarily charge such payment against its   customer’s account, even though the bank acted in good faith   and was not negligent in making the payment. ([Use which-   ever of the following sentences applied:] A forged check is   one signed with the depositor’s name by someone other than   the depositor without the authority from or approval of the   depositor. An altered check is one signed by the depositor   and thereafter altered without authority from or the ap-   proval of the depositor.)      If you are reasonably satisfied from the evidence that   the check drawn on the plaintiffs account which the   defendant bank paid was (forged, altered), your verdict will   be for the plaintiff (in the amount of the check, excess paid   over the amount for which the check was originally drawn).

If you are reasonably satisfied from the evidence that   the plaintiff did not act with reasonable care and prompt-   ness within a reasonable period afforded him by the bank   not exceeding thirty days after his statement (and cancelled   checks) covering a forged or altered check by the same   wrongdoer which he should reasonably have discovered, your   verdict will be for the bank.      CHARGE C:   O27         Bank’s Failure to Exercise Ordinary Care      However, if you are also reasonably satisfied from the   evidence that the defendant bank failed to exercise ordinary   care at the time of payment to discover the forgery or altera-   tion, then the loss is to be allocated between the customer   and the bank to the extent to which their failures contributed   to the loss.      CHARGE D:   Bank’s Failure to Pay in Good Faith      If the customer proves that the bank did not pay in good   faith the item concerning which the customer is suing, the   customer is not precluded or disadvantaged by any of the   rules contained in this jury instruction.      Notes on Use      Subsection 7-4-406(f) states outer time limits within which,   without regard to care or lack of care of either party, the customer   must have notified the bank of defects in checks paid by the bank,   including those in the indorsements and other defects on the back   of the check. This subsection also provides that in cases where the   customer may no longer proceed against his bank, his bank may   not proceed against a prior bank on the same matter. Ala. Code   § 7-4-406(f) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      Ala. Code § 7-4-406 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code), particularly   subsections (a) and (b), contains additional rules applicable to   special situations (truncation) in which neither the checks, nor   copies of them are returned to the customer.

(Name) says   (name) waived it because (state the theory of waiver).      (Name of party) must prove to your reasonable satisfac-   tion from the evidence:      1. That (name of party) knew (he/she/it) had the right;   and,      2. That (name) voluntarily and intentionally sur-   rendered or gave up the right.      Before (name) can waive a right, (he/she/it) must know   all the material facts upon which the waiver depends.      You will consider whether (name)’s conduct shows (he/   she/it) intended to waive the right, or if (his/her/its) conduct   is inconsistent with an intent to insist on the right.      If (name) proved both these things, you must find (name)   waived (state the right).      Approved August 10, 2018      Notes on Use      Case authority that defines waiver does not limit waiver to   “rights.” Some cases use the collective “right, benefit, or advantage.”   See, e.g., Hughes v. Mitchell Co., Inc., 49 So. 3d 192, 201 (Ala.   2010); Nunnelley v. GE Capital Information Technology Solutions-   North America, 730 So. 2d 238, 241 (Ala. Civ. App. 1999). Appel-   late opinions also state that an intentional waiver must be shown   in an “unequivocal manner.” E.g., Putman Const. & Realty Co.,   Inc. v. Byrd, 632 So. 2d 961, 965 (Ala. 1992).      “Though a waiver may be in the nature of an estoppel, and   maintained on similar principles, they are not interchangeable. A   waiver may be created by acts, conduct and declarations insuf-   ficient to create estoppel. Waiver involves the acts and conduct of      530      WAIVER AND ESTOPPEL      only one of the parties; estoppel involves the conduct of both”.   Inland Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hightower, 274 Ala. 52, 56, 145 So. 2d 422,   425 (1962) (internal citations omitted).      References   Mobile County v. Rich, 216 So. 3d 1184 (Ala. 2016).   Hughes v.

Byrd, 632 So. 2d 961, 964   (Ala. 1992). The question presented was did the plaintiff waive its   right to rescind the contract. The Court stated: “A party cannot be   charged with a waiver where the party does not have, at the time   of the waiver, knowledge of all the material facts upon which the   alleged waiver depends.” The party charged with waiver must      have knowledge necessary to make an informed decision.

(A use variance lets the property be used in a way that   is different from what the zoning ordinance allows.)      (An area variance allows a change in the location, size,   dimensions, or placement of a structure on the property.)      You will act as (state the title of the board). You will   decide from the evidence whether to grant the (variance(s)/   special exception(s)) (name of plaintiff) seeks.      The zoning ordinance requires (state the pertinent   requirement). The (variance(s)/special exception(s)) (name of   plaintiff) seeks (is/are): (state the variances or special excep-   tions sought).      (Name of plaintiff) must reasonably satisfy you from the   evidence that you should grant the (variance/special   exception).      Approved March 11, 2016      Notes on Use      Use this instruction as a preliminary instruction, at the close   of the case, or both. It may be modified and used in both “special   exception” and “variance” cases.      When an appeal is taken under Ala. Code § 11-52-81(1975)   (West’s Alabama Code), the circuit court or the jury sits as a “glori-   fied board of adjustment.” Nelson v. Donaldson, 255 Ala. 76, 84, 50   So. 2d 244, 251 (1951). The appeal is de novo, and the issue is   tried as if it has never been tried before. Swann v. Board of Zoning   Adjustment of Jefferson County, Ala., 459 So. 2d 896, 899 (Ala.   Civ. App. 1984). Therefore, the trial judge should not tell the jury   the proceeding is a statutory appeal.      539            The court, or the jury, may only consider those issues which   were raised before the board of zoning adjustment. Ex Parte Board   of Zoning Adjustment of Hueytown v. Warren, 366 So. 2d 1125   (Ala. 1979). Neither the court nor the jury can consider issues   outside the jurisdiction of the board of zoning adjustment, e. g.,   constitutional issues. Those issues may be litigated in a separate   action. City of Homewood v. Caffee, 400 So. 2d 375 (Ala. 1981).      “{A] variance is the authorization of a use of property that con-   stitutes relief from the literal and strict application of the zoning      ordinance that applies to the property .. . .” Harris v. Jefferson   County Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 773 So. 2d 496, 499 (Ala. Civ.   App. 2000).      An area variance is a deviation from the area or dimensional   requirements in the applicable zoning ordinance. “A use variance   permits a deviation from zoning requirements regarding the use of   property.” Ferraro v. Board of Zoning Adjustment of City of   Birmingham, 970 So. 2d 299 (Ala. Civ. App. 2007). Not all cases   fall within the categories of a use or an area variance. See, e. g.,   Lawless v. Smith, 481 So. 2d 1144 (Ala. Civ. App. 1985) (applicant   sought variance to erect commercial sign less than 200 feet from   another sign); Brown v. Jefferson, 203 So. 3d 1213 (Ala. Civ. App.   2014) (applicant sought variance of the number of parking spaces   required for dance studio). Parking space requirements are neither   area nor use variances. 7 Norman Williams, Jr. & John M. Taylor,   American Land Planning § 154:5 (Rev. ed. June 2015).      “[A] special exception denotes a species of administrative   permission which allows a property owner to use his property in a   manner which the regulations expressly permit under conditions   specified in the regulations themselves.” Harris v. Jefferson County   Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 773 So. 2d 496, 497 (Ala. Civ. App.   2000). It does not require a showing of unnecessary hardship. 2   Jesse P. Evans, III, Alabama Property Rights and Remedies   § 42.2[c][ii][4] (5th ed. 2013). A suggested Plain Language defini-   tion is a special exception may be granted when the property meets   the conditions stated in the zoning ordinance.      References      Ala.

You may even decide to allow a use not   allowed by the zoning ordinance. From now on, I will refer to   the zoning ordinance as the ordinance.      You will grant the variance if (name of plaintiff) proves   to your reasonable satisfaction from the evidence that:      1. The property has unique or special conditions which   are not common to other property in the zoning area;      2. Applying the ordinance, as written, will cause an   unnecessary hardship on the property;      3. A variance will not be against the public interest;      4. A variance will be in keeping with the general   purpose of the ordinance; and,      5. A variance will do substantial justice.   Special conditions.      You must decide if the property is unique or has special   conditions. A special condition may be any condition that ex-   ists on the land. For example, the land’s size, its natural and   artificial features, underground conditions, and the like.      Unnecessary hardship.      You must determine if it will be an unnecessary hard-   ship on the property if the ordinance is applied as written.   Keep in mind that an unnecessary hardship, if any, relates   to the property, not its owners. (A mere personal hardship is   not a sufficient reason to grant a variance).      There is no exact definition of unnecessary hardship.   You do not decide unnecessary hardship on just one thing   you find from the evidence. You must base it upon consider-   ation of all the things you find are important on this issue.      542      ZONING      But, when you consider all of them they must indicate to you   that the condition of the property is unique and it cannot   reasonably be put to a use the ordinance allows. If they do,   you will find unnecessary hardship.      Approved March 11, 2016      Notes on Use   This general instruction applies to area and use variances.

A discontinuance happens when the owner   intends to abandon a use and does some act which shows or   implies abandonment of the use.      (It means something more than a temporary absence   from a building for the purpose of making repairs to it.)

Common law marriage   is valid in Alabama and is the functional equivalent of a   statutory marriage. Once it is established, a common law   marriage continues until death or lawful termination.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction only when a party claims a common law   marriage existed before January 1, 2017. The Alabama Legislature   abolished common law marriage effective January 1, 2017, 2016   Ala. Acts 306, Ala. Code § 30-1-20 (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      References   Ala. Code § 30-1-20 states:      “(a) No common-law marriage may be entered into in this   state on or after January 1, 2017.      (b) An otherwise valid common-law marriage entered into   before January 1, 2017, shall continue to be valid in this state.”      Blalock v. Sutphin, 275 So. 3d 519 (Ala. 2018).   Thomas v.

The capacity to enter into a common law marriage;   2. The mutual intent to be husband and wife;      3. Public recognition of the relationship as a marriage;   and      4.

A partnership is an association of two or more persons   to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.      569         Notes on Use      Use to define a partnership as defined in the “Alabama   Uniform Partnership Law” effective January 1, 2011.

A partnership normally arises only from an express or   implied agreement among the parties and not by implication   or by operation of law. The surrounding circumstances as   well as any express agreement between the parties may evi-   dence the intention of the parties necessary to establish such   a partnership relation. If the parties, by written or oral   contract, expressly agree to become partners, a partnership   is created. The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of   a business other than as a payment or interest on a debt,   wages, rent, consideration for sale of good will, or other prop-   erty of the business, is prima facie evidence that he is a   partner. Common interest in the property or the sharing of   gross returns of the business alone does not establish a   partnership.      Notes on Use   Use when there is a question about whether a partnership   exists. This instruction should be used in conjunction with APJI   80.01.      References      Ala. Code § 10A-8-2.02(c) (1975) (West’s Alabama Code).      571            APJI<p>Similar sections in Georgia JI: <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 27.00'> 27.00</a> (100%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 28.01'> 28.01</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 31.12'> 31.12</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 31.11'> 31.11</a> (99%); <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html# 27.01'> 27.01</a> (99%); </p><hr><h4><a class="anchor" name=' 80.03' href='# 80.03'></a> 80.03</h4><p> CONTINUATION AFTER   TERMINATION OF TERM      Caution: The Committee has not updated these instructions to   reflect any changes in legislation that may impact their citation   and use.      When the partners continue the business after the fixed   term, without settlement of the partnership affairs, there is   prima facie evidence that a partnership has continued.

The only transferable interest of a partner in the   partnership is the partner’s share of the profits and losses of   the partnership and the partner’s right to receive   distributions. An assignment of the partner’s interest does   not in itself dissolve the partnership. However, the assignee   only has rights to receive profits to which the assignor would   have been entitled and has no right to participate or interfere   with the management of the partnership or any right to   require access to information or to inspect or copy the   partnership books and records.      Notes on Use      This instruction may be used when a partner has attempted to   assign his right in specific partnership property to a third party.   The instruction is also useful in determining the assignee’s inter-   est in the partnership when a partner has assigned his partner-   ship interest.      References      Ala.

If property, real or personal, is included in the agree-   ment of partnership or acquired in a partnership name or in   a name of one or more partners with an indication in the   instrument transferring title to the property of the person’s   capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership,   then the property is partnership property. Property is   presumed to be partnership property if purchased with   partnership assets. This presumption holds even though the   title or interest is acquired in the name of the individual   partner. Alternatively, if the property is acquired in the   name of an individual without use of partnership assets and   without an indication in the instrument transferring title to   the property of the person’s capacity as a partner or the exis-   tence of a partnership, the property is presumed to be prop-   erty of the individual partner.

When the title to partnership property is in the partner-   ship name, any partner can convey the title in the partner-   ship name. Partnership property held in the name of one or   more partners with an indication in the instrument transfer-   ring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of   the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of   the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an   instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose   name the property is held. The partnership may recover the   property if the execution of the instrument of transfer did   not bind the partnership unless such property has been   conveyed by the grantee or a person claiming through such   grantee to a transferee for value without knowledge that the   conveying partner has exceeded his authority. Partnership   property held in the name of one or more persons other than   the partnership, without an indication in the instrument   transferring the property to them of their capacity as   partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be   transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the   person in whose name the property is held. The partnership   may recover such property if the execution of the instrument   of transfer did not bind the partnership, the transferee knew   or had received notification that the property was partner-   ship property, and that the person who executed the instru-   ment of the initial transfer lacked authority to bind the   partnership. If however, a partner conveys title to partner-   ship property in his own name, only the interest of that   partner in the property is transferred.      Notes on Use      Use this instruction when a question arises about the validity   of a conveyance of partnership property. This instruction is espe-      577            cially relevant to a purchaser for value without knowledge that the   conveying partner has exceeded his authority.

(2) A partner shall be repaid his contributions and the   partnership must indemnify each partner in respect to pay-   ments made and personal liabilities incurred in the preser-   vation or ordinary conduct of business.      (3) A partner shall be repaid for, and receive interest   from the date repayment should be made on, any loan in   excess of the amount of capital which he originally agreed to   contribute.      (4) All partners have equal rights to participate in the   management of the partnership.      (5) A partner may use or possess partnership property   only on behalf of the partnership.      (6) No partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in   the partnership business; except, that a partner is entitled   to reasonable compensation for his services in winding up   the partnership affairs.      (7) No person can become a partner in a partnership   without the consent of all the partners.      (8) Ifthere is a difference as to the ordinary matters of   the partnership, they may be settled by a majority of the   partners. An act outside the ordinary course of business of a   partnership and an amendment to the partnership agree-      Bho            ment may be undertaken only with the unanimous consent   of all the partners.
