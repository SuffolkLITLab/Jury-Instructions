    <h1>Jury Instruction Similarity Project</h1>
    <p>instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive. The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared; both internally within the jury instruction and externally with a different jurisdiction's jury instruction.</p>
