    <h1>Georgia Jury Instructions w/ AI Annotations</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to run a similarities between jury instructions. The "base" jury instruction that will be compared to other instructions is the "Civil Pattern Jury Instructions" from the Georgia Superior Court, provided by the Internet Archive.
    The jury instructions are uploaded from the Internet Archive and are placed into a dataframe, separated by each section of the jury instruction. The jury instructions are then placed in a natural language processing library and each cell of the dataframe is vectorized. 
    Those vectors are placed in a new column within the dataframe; meaning that each row will have a section number, a jury instruction, and an array of vectors. 
    Using cosine similarities, the distance between each vector is measured and compared.</p>

Where conflicts were found to exist among the   decisions of the various circuit courts of appeal interpreting the federal rules of evidence,      the General Assembly considered the decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . The             General Assembly is cognizant that there are many issues regarding evidence that are not   covered by the Federal Rules of Evidence and in those situations the former provisions of   Title 24 have been retained. Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the   General Assembly intends that the substantive law of evidence in Georgia as it existed on      December 31, 2012 be retained.” [emphasis added]             Consistent with the foregoing, the Pattern Jury Instructions Committee has reviewed   all old charges on evidence and made changes keeping in mind the new rules and added   other refinements we felt were needed. Some old charges were retained even where   underlying statutes have been repealed or replaced. In most such instances, it was felt the   old charge could do no harm. The committee has also taken some charges from the I 1th      Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions we felt were clearer and complied with Georgia Law.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <br><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html#121.01'> 121.01</a> VIOLATION OF LAW CONSTITUTES NEGLIGENCE      Negligence is the lack of reasonable care.

Testimony is the statements that you will hear made under oath from the witness(es).   Exhibits are documents, photos, or other items that will be admitted into evidence. You will   then have those exhibits with you in the jury room for use during your deliberations.     I caution you that what the lawyers say during this trial is not evidence. Nothing they   say in their opening statements or their arguments or at any other time during this trial is   evidence. Nor is anything I might do or say evidence in this case.     I have no leanings in this case whatsoever.

The plaintiff   must prove this case by what is known as a “preponderance of the evidence.”     The term “preponderance” means “greater weight,” and as it is used here,   “preponderance of the evidence” means “the greater weight of evidence upon the issues   involved.” The weight of evidence need not be enough to completely free the mind from a   reasonable doubt. However, to be a preponderance, the weight of the evidence must be   sufficient to incline a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to   the other.     (Give the following portion of this charge if an affirmative defense is asserted:     The defendant has filed what is/are known as [an] affirmative defense[s] to the      claim[s] of the plaintiff, specifically [state the affirmative defense(s) asserted]. As to             that/those defense[s], the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of   the evidence.)   If you find that the evidence is evenly balanced on any issue in the case, it would then   be your duty to resolve that issue against the party having the burden of proving that issue.

Therefore, you   must determine which witness or witnesses you will believe and which you will not believe,   if there are any whom you do not believe.     In determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies and the credibility of      witnesses, you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case. You may consider      1) the witnesses’ manner of testifying,     2) their intelligence,     3) their means and opportunity for knowing the facts about which they testify,   4) the nature of the facts about which they testify,      5) the probability or improbability of their testimony,             6) their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and      7) their personal credibility as it appears from the trial.      It is your duty to determine what testimony is worthy of belief and what testimony   is not worthy of belief. You may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of   any witness.     You may also consider the number of witnesses, but the preponderance of evidence      does not necessarily lie with the party who has the greater number of witnesses.

This opening statement itself is not evidence. Remember that what the   lawyers say is not evidence but rather is a preview or outline of what they expect the   evidence to be. Since the plaintiff has the burden of proof, the plaintiff goes first.     Following the opening statements, the plaintiff presents evidence; that is, the plaintiff   calls witnesses and introduces any exhibits. The defendant has the right to cross-examine   these witnesses. When the plaintiff has presented all of his/her evidence, the plaintiff will   rest his/her case.     The defendant then has the opportunity to present his/her case, which means that the   defendant then calls witnesses and introduces exhibits. The plaintiff has the right to cross-      examine the defendant’s witnesses.              After all of the evidence has been presented, the attorneys have the opportunity to   make what is called a closing argument or a summation. At that time, the attorneys will   attempt to point out to you certain parts of the evidence that they think are favorable to their   position and try to persuade you to decide the case in their favor. Both sides have the   opportunity to make this closing argument.     Following the closing arguments, I will charge you more specifically on the law   directly applicable to this case. I will then ask you to retire to the jury room to deliberate and   reach your verdict.     Please remember during the course of this trial to listen carefully to all of the   evidence. Do not jump to conclusions before all of the evidence is presented. Also, please   remember that during the course of this trial, it would be improper for you to discuss this   case with anyone or to allow anyone to discuss the case with you or in your presence or   hearing. You cannot discuss the case with each other in the jury room or elsewhere before      actual deliberations begin, and then only in the presence of all twelve of you.     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <br><p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html#101.02'> 101.02</a> HANDBOOK FOR JURORS      I.

You may take notes, but you are not required to do so. If you   decide to take notes, please remember that note taking should not divert you from paying   full attention to the evidence and evaluating witness credibility. Your observations of the   witnesses during their testimony can be vital to your determination of the believability of   their testimony. The notes that you take are for your use only and are not to be shared with   anyone until you begin deliberation with your fellow jurors. Notes are not evidence, only   memory aids, and should not take precedence over your recollection. It is the duty of each   juror to recall the evidence, and while you may consider another juror’s notes to refresh your   memory, you should rely on your own recollection of the proceedings. Do not be influenced   by the notes of other jurors, unless their notes help you in determining your own   independent recollection. Notes are not entitled to any greater weight than the recollection or   impression of each juror as to what the evidence may have been. After the trial is over, the      notes will be collected and destroyed.             United States v. Rhodes, 631 F.2d 43 (5th Cir.) (1980)   United States v. D. R. McLean, 578 F.2d 64 (3rd Cir.)

This means that during the trial, you   must not conduct any independent research about this case, the matters in the case, and the   individuals or corporations involved in the case. In other words, you should not consult   dictionaries or reference materials; search the Internet, websites, or blogs; or use any other   electronic tools to obtain information about this case or to help you decide the case. Please   do not try to find out information from any source outside the confines of this courtroom—   to include media of any sort or online legal research. Until you retire to deliberate, you may   not discuss this case with anyone, even your fellow jurors. After you retire to deliberate, you   may begin discussing the case with your fellow jurors, but you cannot discuss the case with   anyone else until you have returned a verdict and the case is at an end. I hope that for all of   you this case is interesting and noteworthy. I know that many of you use cell phones,   Blackberries, the Internet, and other tools of technology. You also must not talk to anyone   about this case or use these tools to communicate electronically with anyone about the case.   This includes your family and friends.

Evidence includes all of the testimony of the witnesses as well as the exhibits   admitted during the trial. (It also includes any stipulations, which are facts agreed to by the   attorneys.)     Evidence may be either direct or circumstantial or both.     In considering the evidence, you may use reasoning and common sense to make   deductions and reach conclusions. “Direct evidence” is the testimony of a person who   asserts that he or she has actual knowledge of a fact (such as an eyewitness) (such as by   personally observing or otherwise witnessing that fact). “Circumstantial evidence” is proof   of [a chain or set of] facts and/or circumstances that tend to prove or disprove another fact   by inference (that is, by consistency with such fact or elimination of other facts). There is no   legal difference in the weight you may give to either direct or circumstantial evidence.

Direct evidence is evidence that immediately points to the question at issue.             Circumstantial (or indirect) evidence is evidence that only tends to establish a fact; it   must be such as to reasonably establish that fact rather than anything else. The comparative   weight of circumstantial and direct evidence on any given issue is a question of fact for you      to decide.      Scott v. State, 57 Ga. App. 489 (1938)   O.C.G.A. §24-14-6      (The following are alternative charges as to evidence.)     Direct evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts to   which the witness testifies and that, if believed, is sufficient to prove or establish these facts.     Circumstantial evidence is the testimony of a witness who has seen or heard the facts   to which the witness testifies, from which such facts, if believed, you may find other facts to   exist, that are reasonable and believable to you in the light of your experience.     When circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish a fact or theory, it must be      such as to reasonably establish that fact or theory rather than anything else.      Scott v. State, 57 Ga.

The cases prohibiting the use of “intelligence” in charge are a seeming   egalitarian knee-jerk against correlating intelligence and honesty. But credibility also may   depend on competency. The charge is neutrally drawn and can be adequately argued by   either side.     The jury must determine the credibility of the witnesses. In deciding this, you may   consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the witnesses’ manner of   testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts about which      they testify, the nature of the facts about which they testify, the probability or improbability        General Instructions      of their testimony, their interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and their      personal credibility as you observe it.

One of your first duties in the jury room will be to select   one of your number to act as foreperson, who will preside over your deliberations and who   will sign the verdict to which all twelve of you freely and voluntarily agree.     You should start your deliberations with an open mind. You should carefully   consider all of the evidence in the case and deliberate with an aim toward reaching a   unanimous verdict consistent with your consciences and oaths as jurors. Avoid premature,   fixed opinions. Consult with one another and consider each other’s views. Each of you must   decide this case for yourself, but you should do so only after discussion and consideration of   the case with your fellow jurors. Do not hesitate to change an opinion if convinced that it is   wrong. However, you should never surrender honest convictions or opinions in order to be   congenial or to reach a verdict solely because of the opinions of the other jurors.     You may go now to the jury room, but do not begin your deliberations until I send   you the pleadings, exhibits, and verdict form, which I will do shortly. Then you may begin      your deliberations.        13     <p>Similar sections in Kansas JI: <br><p><b>(99%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html#181.40'> 181.40</a> POSTTRIAL COMMUNICATION WITH JURORS      Ladies and gentlemen, you have completed your duties as jur...</p><p><b>(98%);</b> <a href='GeorgiaSimilarity.html#101.02'> 101.02</a> HANDBOOK FOR JURORS      I.

You have been deliberating this case for a considerable   length of time, and the court deems it proper to advise you further in regard to the   desirability of agreement if possible.     The case has been exhaustively and carefully tried by both sides. It has been   submitted to you for decision and verdict, if possible, rather than for disagreement. It is the   law that a unanimous verdict is required. While this verdict must be the conclusion of each   juror and not a mere acquiescence in order to reach an agreement, it is still necessary for all   the jurors to examine the issues and questions submitted with candor and fairness and with a   proper regard for, and deference to, the opinion of the others.     Each juror should listen to the arguments of other jurors with a disposition to be   convinced by them. If you differ in your views of the evidence, such difference of opinion   should cause you to scrutinize the evidence more closely and to reexamine the grounds of   your opinions.     Your duty is to decide the issues of fact that have been submitted to you, if you can   do so conscientiously. In conferring, you should lay aside all mere pride of opinion and   should bear in mind that the jury room is no place to champion either side of a cause. As   jurors, you should not be advocates. The aim to keep in mind is the truth as it appears from   the evidence, examined in light of the court’s instructions.     You will again retire to your jury room for a reasonable time and examine your      differences in a spirit of fairness and try to arrive at a verdict.      Spaulding v.
